The result, the experience, and the adventure full of obstacles to get there, I found myself again, and I think I unlocked even more things within me! And to top it off, since it\u0026rsquo;s November, I have a mustache for Movember 😎 Doing an IRONMAN with a mustache makes it super special.\n  Two months after the half IRONMAN World Championships in Finland in Lahti, where I finally got good sensations, it was time to go for the A race of the season, the IRONMAN Florida. Two objectives here: validate the progress made in training by going under the 9-hour mark (now we’re talkingl), and secure a second qualification for the IRONMAN World Championships in Hawaii, scheduled for October 2024. This will give us time to prepare for the trip or plan another race if I fail to qualify. Still, some ambition going in, because I believe I have progressed well, and I think the hard work my coach Romain had me do is starting to pay off. I did three weeks with 21 hours of training per week, which surprisingly went well (probably because the coach and the athlete did their job well!).\nUnfortunately, I was leaving for this destination without my wife and daughters because, you know, between the expenses, the time difference, school holidays, etc., it was a bit complicated. But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t alone, as my sister Emilie would make the trip with me! And because we are great sisters and brothers, we convinced our other sister Chloé to join us. In the end, it would be a family trip, even though our big sister Marie was still missing, but that’s for next time!\nWe all met at the Paris airport, and I realised my sisters had prepared a surprise. They prepared badges with our faces on them, announcing that they were my support team, and that we were the \u0026ldquo;Team OG.\u0026rdquo; So cool! We couldn\u0026rsquo;t count the number of people who stared at the badges intently throughout the trip (because we wore them everywhere 😂). I even had several people come up to me and ask if I was a professional athlete. The badges were really, really cool.\n      What a journey to PCB Anyway, the first flight left almost 1 hour late, and we had a connection in Atlanta, with 2 hours to reach the other boarding gate. Sounds like a lot. Except when you arrive in the United States and have to go through customs, pick up your bike suitcase, give it back 100 metres away, go through hand luggage control again, and walk through half of the gigantic airport. We missed the connection by 5 minutes 😑\nIt\u0026rsquo;s almost 22:00 (local time), and here we are at the airline counter to see what we can do. We ultimately have to wait until the next day to take the first flight at 9:50. At least the airline was quite accommodating; since the delay was their fault, they paid for a night in the hotel of our choice. We also had 2 free meals each at the airport. Considering that the hotel we chose was almost €400 per night, we slept well! Not too stressed, just tired; we were the three of us, so it was okay.\n  Finally, we arrived in Panama City Beach, PCB as they say there, and the first surprise upon leaving the airport was that it was 9 degrees, and with the wind, it felt even colder.\n   It can be cold anywhere, even in Florida! In the end, the weather warmed up during the week. We arrived at our hotel, a 27-story building on the beach, impressive 😂 We are not at all in the tourist season, so the building is quite empty, and we have all the facilities just for us: the huge outdoor pool (in case you’re bored with the ocean), the gym, the jacuzzi, the sauna, the cinema (yes, the cinema, with two films a day), and probably other things we didn\u0026rsquo;t see 😂 Well, after these travel adventures, the jacuzzi with a direct view of the sun setting over the ocean was very enjoyable.\n  Going back to the apartment, we even bumped into Arthur Horseau, whom I recognized immediately (he didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize me, despite our super badges!! 😂😂). It\u0026rsquo;s not often that you can meet an athlete of this calibre (he won the Embrunman and finished 6th in the IRONMAN World Championships in Nice this year) in an elevator. Plus, he\u0026rsquo;s super nice!\nThe final training sessions are done, the bike and body are good. On purpose, I eased off with my coach Romain to arrive fresh for the race, and I made the most of this rest to remove the traces of the journey.\n  I\u0026rsquo;ve also developed the habit in recent races of adjusting to the race wake-up time almost a week before, so my body gets used to going to bed and waking up early. It\u0026rsquo;s weird to go to bed at 8:30 pm to wake up at 5 am, but on the morning of the race, you\u0026rsquo;re happy when you\u0026rsquo;ve slept well! Check-in done, everything is ready for the race, and I still have a lot of fun with my sisters; it\u0026rsquo;s really cool to share such a special moment with them. Emilie took over my social medias; I think there has never been so much content in such a short time 😂\nRace morning, a calm wake-up at 5 am, we are a 10-minute walk from the start, which is at 6:50 am. I had been stressing a lot (like really) the day before and during the first half of the night, until around 1:30 am when I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;whatever happens tomorrow, you\u0026rsquo;ve done everything you could to prepare properly. If there\u0026rsquo;s an unexpected event, we\u0026rsquo;ll see at that moment. The ONLY thing you can do until the start is to sleep as well as possible.\u0026rdquo; Believe it or not, the stress vanished, and I fell asleep like a baby. The power of your mind.\nWe head to the race start, a brief video call with my wife a couple thousands of kilometres away for a final cheer on, it\u0026rsquo;s 14 degrees outside, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay! The temperature will rise to 26 in the afternoon, so great weather overall! I settle my bike, fill my transition bags, everything is in place, and I\u0026rsquo;m genuinely relaxed; it\u0026rsquo;s cool. We head to the start line; we have the American anthem sung a cappella, it\u0026rsquo;s very moving. Americans are really serious about the anthem; we felt like time had stopped, no one moved! Big hugs with my sisters (quite a few tears from me), the organisation puts some music on: Lose Yourself by Eminem. Big adrenaline rush, I tell myself that I\u0026rsquo;m not here for fun. Fair enough, I won\u0026rsquo;t make the same mistake as in Finland; I go to the very front in the starting line. ALL THE WAY TO THE FRONT. The pro men start at 6:40 am, the pro women at 6:45 am, and us at 6:50 am. So, I started at 6:50 am, not 51, at 50 because I finally took responsibility 😂\nSwim The swimming consists of 2 loops of 1900m, with an Australian exit on the sand, why not! The first loop goes very well, the water temperature was 23 degrees, so almost too warm with the wetsuit on, and the rising sun is splendid. I feel a bit of current, but there aren\u0026rsquo;t too many waves, so it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to swim. There are thousands of small jellyfish in the water, it\u0026rsquo;s quite funny to pass my hand through them, it reminds me of jelly 😂 They don\u0026rsquo;t sting though, so no risk, but talking to other athletes after the race, I\u0026rsquo;m the only one who found it amusing. A quick run on the sand to start the second loop, with my sisters making more noise than the entire audience combined, impressive 😮\nI completed the first loop in 28', right on time to redo a 56' swim like in Austria, right on track. I start the second loop, but this time with the whole crowd, because the other athletes haven\u0026rsquo;t yet started in the water. A bit tricky to keep the right pace in the middle of packs of swimmers who aren\u0026rsquo;t swimming as fast as me. I lose a bit of time on the second loop, and finished in 58 \u0026lsquo;51\u0026quot;, a bit slower than planned but still well below what I could do before. Quite satisfied overall.\n  No time to wonder, I rush into the bike transition, still fueled by the cheers of my sisters, and with top-notch energy, I feel good. I put my helmet on, grab my nutrition, my lucky charm bracelet (always the same one made for me by Paola 💙), hop on the bike, and I set off for a 180 km ride of flat terrain.\nBike Quite windy out there on the road, but it\u0026rsquo;s manageable, better than the previous days. For those who would say \u0026lsquo;it\u0026rsquo;s easy when it\u0026rsquo;s flat\u0026rsquo;, go outside and ride 180 km on flat terrain. The subtlety is that if you stop pedalling, there won\u0026rsquo;t be a downhill to maintain speed, so you have to pedal all the time, with zero break. And that can really hurt your legs. The same goes for the aero position on the aerobars; except for a few U-turns or stops at the aid stations, you stay in that position, and it\u0026rsquo;s truly exhausting. I rode all alone (literally all alone) until the first aid station at kilometre 50, without moving out from my aerobars, so about 1 hour and 15 minutes in the same position. I had sore trapezius muscles after the race 😂\nAnyway, it\u0026rsquo;s going well; I catch up with other athletes, including some pro women, they are so impressive 😮 Again, some of the athletes don’t follow the drafting rules, but this time I tell them off myself 😂, especially when they try to hide behind me. I don\u0026rsquo;t know where the referees are once again, so be it. Anyway, we\u0026rsquo;re riding strong, and my legs feel good. I\u0026rsquo;m holding the watts I had planned, with the good position I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on and the disc wheel, it’s going fast!\nThe scenery is quite nice, but you have to enjoy long straight lines. In the end, I don\u0026rsquo;t really notice the time passing; I stick to my hydration/nutrition plan and make sure to wet myself with water as often as possible. It\u0026rsquo;s getting hot compared to the beginning of the bike, so it’s better not to start overheating. I started feeling the urge to pee after 3 hours (important detail!), the first time it has happened to me during a race. Let’s be clear on that, I kept the contents of my bladder INSIDE my bladder. And there you go, that was the standout moment on the bike!\nTo sum up the bike leg, I\u0026rsquo;m quite satisfied with my performance. I had energy throughout the course, was able to push even towards the end of the 180 km, overtaking a few people who didn\u0026rsquo;t seem as fresh as me. Romain had warned me that I might get tired around 130-140 km and would need to push through, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. Looking back, I might have been a bit too conservative. I already know he\u0026rsquo;s got some surprises prepared for me in next year\u0026rsquo;s bike training sessions! 😂\nI finish the bike leg after a final long straight stretch along the seaside, no time to look at the splendid houses. It took me 4 hours, 36 minutes, and 34 seconds to complete 180 km, averaging 39.2 km/h. I\u0026rsquo;ve made good progress 😂😂.\n   Run My two sisters are at the bike transition to cheer me on! To be honest I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite catch everything they were saying, because of the wind in my ears, being careful not to fall while getting off the bike, and my urge to pee. Too much information to process.\nI head straight to the toilet; I thought it would never end. It actually scared Emilie when she saw me heading that way; she thought I had belly issues. But no, I was feeling great!\nA smooth transition, moving quickly but making sure not to forget anything. As all coaches say, \u0026lsquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t confuse speed with haste\u0026rsquo; 😂 (at least that’s what French coaches say!) I grab my sunglasses, a cap, my nutrition, and hydration in my hands and start running. I then place them in the right spots (nutrition in the back pockets of the tri suit, cap on my head, etc. you get the idea), a little trick to save time in transition.\nI rush out of transition to start the marathon, hearing Chloé telling me I\u0026rsquo;m 4th in my age group, the two ahead are less than 2 minutes away, and the first is 6 minutes ahead. Let the hunt start.\nTwo loops of 21 km for this marathon. Romain and I had discussed a strategy for the marathon. Start the first 10 km coasting, maintain a good pace for the next 20 km to let fatigue set in, and then let it go (as much as possible 😅) in the last 10. The first kilometre feels really good, even at almost 15 km/h, it feels like an easy jog. I manage myself and don\u0026rsquo;t get carried away; I stick to an easy pace, as the coach said. I pass a pro female athlete (a Canadian) who catches up just after, and she asks if I\u0026rsquo;m aiming for a sub-3-hour marathon. I say yes. She looks thrilled and asks if she can run with me, why not!\nAfter my fantastic experience with Read during the World Championships in Finland, here I am embarking on another adventure with Erin Snelgrove. The kilometres pass effortlessly at 4'09\u0026quot;/km (14.5 km/h), in a controlled stride and taking enough water at each aid station. It\u0026rsquo;s 26 degrees with bright sunshine. It\u0026rsquo;s great to run with Erin; she has a beautiful stride and tells me she\u0026rsquo;s currently 7th among the pros and wants to finish 5th.\nWe run into Emilie after 13 or 14 kilometres. She tells me I\u0026rsquo;m in 3rd place (I overtook a competitor without realising it), the 2nd is 1 minute ahead but starting to struggle, and the leader is now only 3 minutes ahead. The chase continues.\nEnd of the first loop, 21 km without a hitch, still with Erin by my side, who tells me that I\u0026rsquo;m a real metronome; it\u0026rsquo;s indeed one of my strengths 😀.\n  I head out for the second loop, and I sense after an aid station that Erin is struggling to pick up the pace, she might have a slight dip in energy. I try to wait for her, but she doesn\u0026rsquo;t catch up, and with a bit of sadness, I resume my pace. It\u0026rsquo;s still an individual race, and I still have the first two to catch!\nI run into Chloé at the 23rd kilometre, who tells me I\u0026rsquo;ve passed the 2nd (I don\u0026rsquo;t know when 🤷) and that the leader is now only 2 minutes ahead. Three thoughts cross my mind:\n I\u0026rsquo;m going to finish the race easily; I still have energy. I\u0026rsquo;m going to chase down the first one. I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll qualify for Hawaii if I keep this up.  For whatever reason, I speed up a bit (0.5 km/h faster) because it feels effortless. A few kilometres later, I see Emilie, who tells me that I\u0026rsquo;m only a minute and thirty seconds behind the first and that Romain told her he has never run a marathon in less than 3 hours, so I have the advantage. She manages to convey all this information and add encouragementon top of it in record time; she spoke so loudly that you probably heard the echo all the way to France 😂 As I mentioned before, my sisters were an incredible support team! Before the race, we discussed the information I wanted to have during the race and the trigger phrases to motivate me. They executed it perfectly.\nI reach the 28th kilometre, and I start to feel that it\u0026rsquo;s getting challenging, even though I\u0026rsquo;m gradually gaining time. I haven\u0026rsquo;t made the last U-turn for the final 10 kilometres yet. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have leg pain, but I began to feel a bit of fatigue. Even though we\u0026rsquo;re closer to the end of the race than the beginning, 14 km can feel very, very long if you\u0026rsquo;re struggling. The 4'09\u0026quot;/km pace I\u0026rsquo;ve been maintaining since the start slows down to 4'20\u0026quot;/km for 3 km, and the fatigue persists. I get to the next aid station, which is 50 metres before the U-turn, and I think to myself, \u0026lsquo;Okay, you can walk for 5 seconds, then get back to it.\u0026rsquo; I take a good sip of water, walk easily, counting 5 seconds in my head, then resume and make the U-turn. And I was back in the game. I have 10 km left to enjoy and make the most of the end of this race, which has gone exceptionally well so far, to go after the first place and crush my time on the distance. I get back into the right pace, although honestly\u0026hellip; it hurts 😅.\nI start a countdown in my head, only 8 kilometers left. 7 kilometers. I pass a guy who looks strong. He has a ton of sponsors on his tri suit. I have a look at his bib, and I see that he\u0026rsquo;s a pro. I\u0026rsquo;ve just overtaken a pro triathlete, even though he started 10 minutes before me. I think he must be having a very bad day, and I also think that I\u0026rsquo;ve made significant progress. It\u0026rsquo;s important for my personal pride 😂.\n500 metres later, I hear the first athlete who is going to overtake me during this marathon, and it\u0026rsquo;s not an athlete but a female athlete. It\u0026rsquo;s Erin, who has finally caught up with me. She says something, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what because I\u0026rsquo;m a bit struggling. However, I stay just behind her and try to hang on. Only 4 kilometres left. I see a tall building not so far away and set myself a goal to get back next to Erin (not behind her) starting from that building. We reach the building, and here we are, side by side again for the final 3 kilometres. There\u0026rsquo;s much more atmosphere in this part of the race, and even though my legs are starting to send me distress signals, there\u0026rsquo;s no way I\u0026rsquo;m slowing down.\n1 kilometre to go, my hamstrings are on the brink of cramping. I\u0026rsquo;m fully focused not to make a misstep; otherwise, I’m probably going to have a hard time getting back up. Erin picks up the pace even more, breaching by a few metres. I tell her to go on and keep going. Less than a hundred metres to go, I see Chloé one last time, who tells me the leader is 20 seconds ahead. A little shot of adrenaline, and I pick up the pace too.\nLast right turn to head towards the end. I see the finish line, and it feels like I\u0026rsquo;ve launched into a crazy sprint. In my head, it’s like I’m running at least at 20 km/h. In reality, it\u0026rsquo;s 16 km/h 😂 but not too bad for the end of an IRONMAN marathon. I finished it in 2 hours and 58 minutes. Here’s the sub 3h marathon! No idea what happens next; I\u0026rsquo;m shattered. A volunteer talks to me and walks with me to the finish tent. I must have told her my life, but I don\u0026rsquo;t exactly remember what. I just recall being really happy with my race, relieved to have finished, and I gave her the bracelet we received as a gift to thank her for participating in organising the race.\nI meet Erin just after that; she tells me she ultimately finished 4th in the race, beyond her expectations! And she says it was so cool to have run together. I can’t agree more!\nI finished 2nd in 8h42’04”, just 50 seconds behind Victor, not 20 seconds. He was indeed 20 seconds ahead of me when Chloé saw him (because she actually started a timer when she saw him pass by), but he must have started 30 seconds behind me at the beginning! It just goes to show that in the end, it\u0026rsquo;s the little details that matter. Those 50 seconds are probably about the time I spent in the toilets during the transition after the bike 😑.\nTalking to him the next day, he\u0026rsquo;ll tell me he was really scared because his wife told him I was catching up to him. It was close! I jokingly told him we would meet again in Hawaii for a rematch. We both laughed, but we also know we weren\u0026rsquo;t joking at all, and we\u0026rsquo;ll do our best to beat the other ah ah ah 😂. We still are competitors even if we respect each other.\nAnyway, I leave the post-race tent and meet my sisters, and we can all let our emotions out; there\u0026rsquo;s quite a bunch to release 😂. I need to sit for a bit at a table because I don\u0026rsquo;t feel great, I\u0026rsquo;m starting to get cold, and I\u0026rsquo;m a bit nauseous, but it goes away in a few minutes. I\u0026rsquo;ve never experienced this after a race, but it makes me realise that I truly gave it all in the race.\nI video call Audrey; I can finally tell her that we did it, and we\u0026rsquo;re going back to Hawaii 😀 (I\u0026rsquo;m taking a break in writing the report to grab some tissues ahahah). While I was on the phone, my sisters went to get ice cream to recharge. So many emotions during this race!\n   Once again, I\u0026rsquo;ve shared quite a bit about my life! But there were some adventures to tell. I didn\u0026rsquo;t come to Florida for fun! Now, it\u0026rsquo;s time for the 2024 season, with Hawaii as the highlight, and this time the race report will be a good one!\n    Thank you for reading this far. The 2023 season ended on a positive note, and there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of hope and expectations for the next one 😀\nWhat can I say, other than a massive thank you to all the people who support me in my adventures—my beloved daughters, my family, my friends, my colleagues (current or former), my coach Romain Guillaume, my partners (Tacher Acogex, Culture Vélo Le Havre, Precision Fuel \u0026amp; Hydration), my club the HAC Triathlon, my company Doctolib, and my village of Mannevillette (it was so funny when the speaker mentioned my name and village to call me on the podium).\nA special mention to my two sisters, my crew for this race, who must have been as tired as me after the race given how much energy they spent. We had a lovely week together on another continent, and we have so many new memories. Mum, I took good care of my sisters, and they took good care of me 😂.\nAudrey, even 7,000 km away, you were with me 💙💙💙.\n  Data time!

Le réveil était censé sonner il y a 1h, et 5h30 c’était l’heure du départ pour se rendre aux championnats du monde de half IRONMAN qui avaient lieu ce matin là. Il y a une heure de route et le parc à vélo ferme à 7h30, autant dire qu’on commence à être en flux tendu. Encore une course qui démarre bien!\nIl s’est passé pas mal de choses depuis l’échec d’Hawaï en Octobre dernier, et inutile de rappeler qu’en rentrant, je n’allais pas en rester là. Audrey m’avait prévenu “Si tu t’arrêtes là dessus tu vas le regretter toute ta vie”, et comme j’écoute toujours ma femme (même si je ne l’admets pas toujours), on a décidé de la suite. Il en est ressorti deux choses: Le triathlon ça prend du temps et il faut trouver le bon équilibre avec la vie de famille et la vie professionnelle. Faire une sortie vélo de 6h le dimanche matin c’est franchement pas un cadeau, pour celui (ou celle en l\u0026rsquo;occurrence) qui doit garder les enfants et aussi pour celui qui part rouler! Donc quitte à mettre le paquet pour s\u0026rsquo;entraîner, autant trouver du temps pour le faire avec le moins d’impact possible. C’est là où j’ai sollicité mon entreprise (Doctolib) pour passer à 80% (encore une bonne idée de ma femme). Et j’en profite pour les remercier (merci Florian et Stan pour votre confiance). Le jeudi sera désormais pour s\u0026rsquo;entraîner, et vu les séances que j’allais manger, c’était pas de trop. Passé un certain niveau de performance, on commence aussi à chercher à maximiser l\u0026rsquo;entraînement pour qu’il soit le plus efficace possible, et comme le volume d’entraînement est un gros facteur de progression, je ne voulais pas me tromper dans la méthode. C’est pourquoi j’ai demandé de l’aide d’un coach, c’est là qu’entre en scène Romain Guillaume, triathlète pro, chaudement recommandé par Hind, une triathlète que j’avais rencontré en 2019 pour l’IRONMAN de Finlande (coucou Hind!).\nDepuis Novembre dernier, je me suis remis au travail, avec beaucoup d’application, et pleins de nouveaux conseils et méthodes venant de Romain. Pas une révolution en soit puisque le principe reste le même. De la régularité, de la progressivité et du volume et de l’intensité aux bons moments. Le fait de ne pas tout décider relâche beaucoup le stress, sachant qu’il est parfois difficile\td’être objectif lorsque l’on “s’auto coach”. Romain m’a beaucoup rassuré et décomplexé sur la façon de s\u0026rsquo;entraîner, et surtout des moments où il ne faut plus s\u0026rsquo;entraîner. Il m’a aussi apporté son expérience de pro et des séances que je n’aurais JAMAIS osé faire, parce que je me serais dit que c’était du suicide. Et finalement ça passe, même quand il programme 7h d\u0026rsquo;entraînement un jeudi. Même pas mal. Même quand l’intitulé de la séance c’est “Enchaînement du vélo - ça va piquer !!!!!!!!”. A la fin, le coach sait mieux que nous même ce dont on est capable. “Trust the coach, trust the process”. Qu’on soit bien d’accord, globalement tout s’est bien déroulé, il y a quand même des séances où on se sent minable et tout est dur alors que c’est une séance tranquille, des moments où on resterait bien au chaud à la maison parce qu’on est fatigué et qu’il pleut dehors (il pleut jamais en Normandie). Et le lendemain tu as l’impression d’être une machine de guerre pendant la séance la plus dure de la semaine. Pas facile de comprendre comment notre corps fonctionne des fois 😂\nBref, avoir un coach du calibre de Romain, c’est une super expérience!\nPetit retour sur début 2023 Pour cette année, j’avais 4 grosses échéances: Le triathlon de Vendôme fin Ma (distance half IRONMAN) L’IRONMAN de Klagenfurt en Autriche à la fin Juin (pour aller faire tomber les chronos) Les championnats du monde de Half IRONMAN à Lahti en Finlande (c’est de ça qu’on parle dans ce rapport pour ceux qui ne suivent pas) fin Août, grâce à ma qualification à Weymouth en Angleterre en Septembre 2022 (où j’avais gagné dans ma catégorie, et où je n’avais pas pris le temps d’écrire un rapport de course!) l’IRONMAN de Floride aux Etats-Unis début Novembre… pour aller chercher une fois de plus la qualification à Hawaï en 2024 Beau programme!\nLe début de saison avec les cross s’est plutôt bien déroulé, même s’il me restait des douleurs au talon (des suites de mon opération un an plus tôt! C’est long la rééducation quand ça touche aux tendons), l\u0026rsquo;entraînement se passait bien et j’ai commencé à reprendre confiance.\nUne deuxième place au triathlon L de Vendôme à la fin Mai a confirmé que la forme était revenue, même si j’ai souffert et que j’étais assez déçu de ma course à pied. Peut être que certains diront “ah bah c’est quand même bien de finir sur le podium en faisant pas une bonne course”, oui mais c’est loin d’être satisfaisant, j’ai fait quelques erreurs que je n’aurais pas dû faire, et j’avais surtout envie de bien faire pour me remettre en selle après Hawaï. Bref, la course m’a laissé un goût d’inachevé et une petite douleur au talon, alors que j’avais l’impression que l’histoire était belle et bien terminée. J’ai senti pendant la partie course à pied plusieurs fois mon talon qui piquait un peu, il faut dire que les parties dans les chemins d’herbes hautes rendaient le sol instable.\nLa douleur s’est confirmée quand j’ai repris l\u0026rsquo;entraînement, et mon kiné (ce cher Antoine) m’a confirmé qu’il y avait une petite inflammation, rien de très grave mais qu’il faudrait être patient. Sauf que l’IRONMAN d’Autriche était un mois après. J’ai fait de mon mieux pendant ce laps de temps pour faire avec l’inflammation, elle ne s’est pas améliorée mais n’a pas empiré. J’étais tellement habitué à cette douleur qu’elle ne m’a pas empêché de m\u0026rsquo;entraîner.\nArrivé à en Autriche je m’étais fait une raison, on verra bien pendant la course! C’est dommage parce que cette course aussi mériterait son rapport de course, mais là franchement c’est dur de tout faire. Soit je fais un bon résumé, soit je m’abstiens. Je ne peux pas me résoudre à écrire un truc à la va vite. Et écrire le rapport me prend facilement 5h, souvent à coup d’une demi-heure par ci par là. Bref, mis à part les paysages magnifiques de l’Autriche, j’ai sorti la meilleure natation de ma vie en 56’, je visais moins d’une heure, je n’ai pas été déçu. Enfin l’impression d’être plus du côté d’un poisson dans l’eau que d’un caillou. J’avais fait quelques séances avec Valéry (Toupin) avant cette course et dans ma tête je n’arrêtais pas de me dire “fais le dauphin comme Valéry”.\nDe l’intérieur ça semblait marcher, vu de l’extérieur… je ne sais pas, mais j’étais quand même content de moi! Enchaînement sur le vélo au poil et un super parcours de 180km, où je me suis clairement bien amusé. Seule la dernière heure commençait à être un peu dure, mais j’ai sorti le meilleur vélo de ma vie aussi en 4h58’, à 36km/h de moyenne, cool! Enchaînement à pied au poil également, et étonnamment zéro douleur au talon, j’étais euphorique. Je passe les 10 premiers kilomètres en 42’, parfait pour l’objectif de moins de 3h sur le marathon et sous les 9h au total. Je me sentais vraiment bien jusqu’à ce que mon talon me rappelle à l’ordre et me dise stop. J’ai serré les dents, puis j’ai commencé à ralentir, puis à boiter de plus en plus.\nJe me suis alors dit deux choses:\n Je finis la première boucle (la course était composée de 2 boucles de 21km) parce qu’Audrey m’attend là bas, et je ne veux pas qu’elle s’inquiète J’arrête la course ici, je sais que je peux la finir mais si c’est pour endommager mon talon, aucun intérêt. Ce n’était pas une course majeure (à part aller chercher un chrono), et le reste de l’épreuve c’était très bien passé.  Je m’arrêterais donc au kilomètre 21, mais sans regret et avec l’esprit tranquille. Audrey était bien plus dégoutée que moi! Je me souviens juste lui avoir dit: “Mon talon me fait mal ça sert à rien de continuer, c’est un peu frustrant. En plus je ne suis même pas fatigué”. Et c’était vrai, j’étais pas spécialement fatigué, même pas mal aux jambes. Plutôt un bon signe, la préparation était vraiment bonne. Mais on n\u0026rsquo;est pas là pour parler de l’Autriche!\nDes sponsors! Après ça, sont arrivées TROIS super nouvelles, j’ai trouvé TROIS sponsors pour m’accompagner 🎉\nC’est une action que j’avais initié avant Hawaï (un peu dans la précipitation il faut dire) et mon club et la ville du havre avait répondu présent pour me donner un coup de main (financier). Cette fois-ci j’ai encore mis à contribution mon book pour démarcher des entreprises. C’est assez dérangeant et bizarre (pour moi) de faire ça. Le sport est une passion et je ne le fais pas pour gagner de l’argent. Mais c’est un bon moyen d’impliquer des acteurs locaux, ou simplement faire participer des gens à une aventure sportive.\nC’est comme cela qu’en Juin, l’entreprise Tacher Acogex, cabinet d’experts-comptables, s’est portée volontaire pour m’accompagner dans mon projet sportif. Je ne pourrai jamais remercier suffisamment Laura de croire en moi! C’est ensuite Precision Fuel \u0026amp; Hydration, une entreprise de nutrition sportive britannique qui m’a offert son soutien, et vu la quantité de nourriture que l’on ingère pour s\u0026rsquo;entraîner en triathlon, cette aide est la bienvenue. Et j’ai également la chance de pouvoir compter sur Culture Vélo Le Havre pour m’épauler, et me garantir de la performance en m’aidant à financer l’acquisition d’une roue lenticulaire, et l’entretien de mon matériel. C’est un énorme plus pour ma pratique!!\nMerci à tous pour votre soutien!\nEn route pour la Finlande Revenons à nos moutons. Nous voilà partis pour la Finlande (nos deux filles, Audrey et moi), accompagnés de nos chers amis Mélanie et Vincent et leurs deux enfants. Bon j’ai dû prendre l’avion la veille parce que mon vélo avait été refusé une semaine avant pour une histoire de quota de bagages hors format. Je vous passe la panique, le changement de vol avec frais supplémentaire, et les frais annexes en plus (train, nuit d’hôtel, etc.). Même si c’est pas la première qu’il nous arrive des bricoles, c’est beaucoup d’énergie et de stress. Tout le monde est arrivé sains et saufs, et nous voilà de nouveau sur les routes de Finlande au milieu des forêts et des lacs, après un dernier coup de stress parce qu’on a eu du mal à faire rentrer la housse du vélo dans la voiture (on a eu chaud pas vrai Vincent?). Franchement il ne faut pas voyager avec un vélo c’est “un peu” galère.\nJe ne vais pas vous faire un récit de nos vacances, mais entre la maison au bord du lac sans voisins à portée de voix, la pêche à la sauterelle, les balades en barque et la peau d’ours sur le mur du salon, c’était un vrai bonheur d’être là.\n   IRONKIDS Les enfants ont aussi eu droit à leur première course pour l’IRONKIDS, enfin sauf Livia qui avait déjà fait sa première course à Hawaï (il y a pire comme début dans le sport). Un autre moment plein d’émotions, Pénélope, du haut de ces 1 an et demi, à fait les 300 mètres d’une traite (elle a essayé d’aller manger le cookie d’un enfant sur le bord aussi), Esteban est parti tellement vite qu’il a failli nous semer, et Paola nous a fait un sprint d’anthologie de 200 mètres. Trop cool! Tout ça dans un stade d’athlétisme gigantesque, au pied des tremplins de saut à ski, très très impressionnant.\n   Un jour de course Si vous vous souvenez du début du récit, on s’est levé en retard, mais on est quand même arrivé à l’heure et avant la fermeture du parc à vélo, finalement on s’est mis la pression pour rien, ah ah… J’étais étonnamment serein ce matin, Audrey pas tellement, alors que d’habitude c’est l’inverse. C’est bien des fois d’échanger les rôles. Parce que le stress d’avant course n\u0026rsquo;est vraiment pas la partie que je préfère.\nOn arrive sur le lieu de la course sans problème, je passe au parc à vélos. Tout est ok, le vélo est prêt (avec ma magnifique roue lenticulaire que j’ai acquise grâce à Culture Vélo Le Havre!), j’ai déposé mes bouteilles dessus, les chaussures sont clipsées sur les pédales et maintenues par des élastiques (pour pouvoir sauter sur le vélo à la sortie de la transition), et les pneus sont bien gonflés. Direction la zone de départ à environ 1km de là. Les pros ont déjà commencé et sont sortis de l’eau, j’aurai bien aimé aller les voir mais moi aussi je fais la course!\nPetit footing de 5min, je mets la combi, je nage 5min (une très bonne habitude que j’ai prise, ça m’évite d’avoir les épaules qui brûlent en début de course, très désagréable), même si je ne suis pas fan de me mouiller avant de partir. Il est 8h20 et mon départ est dans 10 minutes. Donc je me dis que ce serait pas mal d’y aller. Je finis de me préparer, tout le monde me souhaite bonne chance, je verse une petite larme (la base), c’est tellement cool d’avoir ma famille et mes amis à mes côtés.\nJe pars pour la zone de départ, chaque groupe d’âge part séparément toutes les 15min, avec un rolling start (c’est-à-dire par groupe de 7). Je suis étonnamment seul, même si le départ est dans 5 minutes. Je me dis quand même que c’est bizarre que personne ne soit là 5 minutes avant le départ, et puis je me dis ensuite qu’en fait je dois plutôt être le SEUL QUI N\u0026rsquo;EST PAS ENCORE dans la zone de départ. Petit coup de stress et un sprint plus tard, je rejoins les quelques 500 autres athlètes de ma catégorie, qui étaient déjà tous prêts. Des fois je mérite une petite (grosse selon ma femme) tape derrière la tête. Le mec prend son temps sans paniquer et a failli louper le départ.\nC’est pas comme s’il ne m’était jamais arrivé de bricoles. Bref, me voilà prêt, j’essaie de me faufiler pour aller un peu à l’avant mais je me retrouve vite coincé, et je m’en veux parce que je sais que je vais nager avec des triathlètes moins rapides que moi dans l’eau, et ça c’est pas bon. Cela veut dire que je vais passer mon temps à slalomer et perdre du temps. Une erreur de plus à ne pas refaire. On part d’un ponton qui est à un mètre au-dessus de l’eau, je le savais à l’avance donc j’ai pû pratiquer le plongeon pour avoir la technique et ne pas perdre mes lunettes en cours de route. Je suis serein et chaud pour y aller.\nA mon tour!\nNatation Quelques mètres à courir avant de plonger, où tout le monde se bouscule joyeusement (on reste tous des garçons qui aiment se chahuter dans le fond ah ah ah), et je “plonge”. Le plongeon en lui même n\u0026rsquo;était pas mauvais (j’ai pas fait de plat), mais les deux gars à côté de moi ont fait un saut pieds joints en me poussant en même temps, donc j’ai plongé bien de travers. Et j’ai perdu mes lunettes au passage… je ressors les lunettes de travers, heureusement que personne ne voit, je les remets et je fais le moulin avec mes bras pour me faire une place. Désolé ceux qui ont pris des coups, c’est le jeu. En même temps j’en ai pris quelques-uns aussi.\nLa natation se passe bien, même si comme prévu je passe mon temps à doubler et à zigzaguer pour dépasser les gens. L’eau est moins froide que prévu (18 degrés), probablement à cause de la quantité d’adrénaline qui circule dans mes veines. Je dois plusieurs fois m’arrêter complètement parce que des gros paquets se sont formés. C’est un peu chaotique. Globalement j’aurais quand même bien nagé, et bien mieux que les années précédentes, en 28’55”. Je sais que j’aurais pû nager plus vite, mais encore aurait-il fallu arrêter d’être dans la lune au départ!\nBeaucoup de spectateurs et pas mal d’ambiances pour la transition, avec tous mes supporters sur le côté! Le parc à vélo est assez grand donc il y a quand même pas mal de trajet pour récupérer le sac, se changer, prendre mon bracelet porte bonheur (confectionné par Paola 💙), prendre le vélo et partir sur le parcours. 5 minutes plus tard, je passe la ligne de montée et monte prudemment sur mon vélo, j’avais quand même un peu froid aux mains.\n   Vélo Le début de course est roulant, comme le reste finalement, pas de difficultés majeures à part quelques côtés qui ne durent jamais plus de 5-10 minutes, donc autant vous dire que ça roulait vite! Les routes sont droites et bien entretenues, c’est très agréable. Pas mal de monde déjà sur le vélo, nous étions (les 30-34 ans) partis après beaucoup d’autres catégories. Après quelques kilomètres, une invitée (bien trop connue en Normandie) est arrivée pour la fête. La pluie. Pas les gouttes de pluie. Les GROSSES averses. Une minute plus tard j’étais trempé, et la pluie ne s’est pas arrêtée jusqu’à la fin de la journée. J’avais l’impression d’être à la bataille du gouffre de Helm dans le seigneur des anneaux. On pense vraiment à des choses bizarres pendant une course. J’ai aussi pensé à mon discours de la semaine d’après, car je devenais le parrain de la fille de mes amis.\nVoilà, sous la pluie battante, avec les bras de plus en plus gelés, et à faire gaffe de ne pas tomber. Pas grand chose à dire pendant le vélo puisque je ne voyais rien avec la pluie, à part les mecs qui roulent en peloton alors que c’est interdit, pendant que les arbitres passent sans rien dire.\nÇa me sidère. Les gars sont là aux championnats du monde de half IRONMAN et ils trichent (à partir du moment où tu ne respectes pas les règles, c’est de la triche, soyons honnêtes). Un peu déçu de l’attitude des athlètes, mais peut être que j’en demande trop. J’aurais bien aimé que les arbitres de l’IRONMAN d’Autriche soient là, eux ils étaient intransigeants. Je me souviens que j’étais dans un groupe de 7, je faisais bien attention à respecter la distance de drafting (c’est-à-dire suffisamment loin du vélo devant moi pour ne pas être dans la zone d’aspiration et risque une pénalité de 5 minutes), mais j’étais le seul. Les arbitres sont passés une fois en moto, se sont arrêtés au rond point suivant, et sont repassés en mettant un carton de pénalité à tout le monde sauf moi. Ah ah ah.\nEn tout cas, le plus dur était de boire parce que j’avais les mains tellement gelées que je n’arrivais pas à appuyer sur ma gourde. J’arrive à la fin du parcours et j’entends le doux son du mégaphone de ma femme, quel plaisir! Je commençais tout de même à avoir mal aux jambes à la fin, mais rien de méchant, pour l’instant tout roulait. 2h15’50” pour faire les 90km, 39,7km/h de moyenne, je n’ai jamais roulé aussi vite!\nLa zone de transition est un énorme (mais énorme!) hangar dédié au sport, et il me faut encore plus de 4 minutes pour faire la transition à pied. C’est dingue la taille des infrastructures sportives dans cette ville de Lahti.\n  Course à pied A part les doigts gelés, le reste du corps va bien, et je m’élance joyeusement pour un semi marathon, bien décidé à me faire plaisir et à annuler la malédiction de mon talon.\nLe parcours à pied est assez exigeant, avec quelques bosses et des montées très longues. Plus de 200m de dénivelé positif, c’est beaucoup sur un semi. Pas du tout une course plate donc inutile d’espérer aller chercher un chrono fantastique. 2 tours de 10,5km, avec un passage sur le stade où l’on avait fait l’IRONKIDS. La course alterne des passages en forêt, traverse des habitations en bord de lac, c’est vraiment une course à pied sympa.\nPremier tour bouclé sans encombre, avec des supers sensations. J’ai doublé beaucoup de monde et je courre à plus de 16km/h, je suis vraiment très satisfait. Je me souviens être passé devant le panneau 15km (pour le deuxième tour), et m’être dit “quand tu passeras là au deuxième tour, plus rien ne pourra t’arriver, donc ce sera le moment de profiter à fond”. J’ai croisé tous mes supporters, qui malgré la pluie sont présents pour m’encourager.\n  Je démarre la seconde boucle et je sens qu’un athlète commence à me rattraper. C’est la première personne qui va me doubler, et je me dis que c’est le moment de s’accrocher et de voir ce qu’il me reste dans les jambes. La personne arrive à ma hauteur et je me cale sur son rythme, qui n’est finalement pas beaucoup plus élevé que le mien. On ne s’est pas regardé mais j’ai senti un accord tacite et une synchronisation qui s’est tout de suite établie. Peut-être que certain(e)s trouveront ça étrange mais la connexion était là. Et le festival a pu commencer! On s’est mis à un très bon rythme et on a avalé la concurrence. J’avais l’impression d’être un rouleau compresseur et les kilomètres défilaient sans effort. C’était vraiment grisant. C’est ainsi que j’ai fait la connaissance de Read (Ziegler). Bien qu’ayant des foulées très différentes, lui très puissante et plutôt terrestre, et moi assez élastique et aérienne (une vraie biche), on se relançait mutuellement dans les montées et les descentes. Il a quand même un physique impressionnant et j’ai l’impression de courir à côté de terminator 😂\nEn passant le 15ème kilomètre, je me suis dit que c’était encore plus facile que je croyais de profiter du moment présent. On vit parfois des aventures assez inédites, je suis au milieu de la Finlande avec mes proches, en train de participer aux championnats du monde de half IRONMAN. Il pleut averse, j’ai eu une année compliquée sur le plan physique, mais je viens de trouver un copain pour courir la fin du semi marathon et je me sens super bien. Quel kif!\nOn arrive au 19ème kilomètre et la course se termine bientôt, et je me décide à entamer la conversation avec Read. On a couru presque 10km côte à côte sans échanger une parole, même en commençant à courir ensemble. Il me dit que c’est son premier tour, puisqu’il est dans la catégorie 25-29 ans et ils sont partis après nous. Je lui dis que je suis triste de devoir finir la course et que j’aurais bien fait un troisième tour, même si bon, je me sens bien mais je commence quand même à fatiguer. Il me dit enfin que je vais lui manquer 🤗 Il reste 1km, je dis à Read que je vais lâcher les chevaux pour finir la course, et je lui souhaite de s’amuser et de se faire plaisir sur le deuxième tour, ce à quoi il me répond un “Yes, Sir” tellement américain ah ah ah. Je passe en trombe devant mes supporters, et finis la course dans un état un peu second, tellement soulagé d’enfin sortir une bonne course sans douleur. J’ai un vague souvenir “d’exprimer ma joie” (lire crier de toutes mes forces) avant la dernière ligne droite et la ligne d’arrivée, et boucler ce semi marathon en 1h19’12” et cette course en 4h12’18”. Mon meilleur chrono sur cette distance, malgré le parcours assez difficile et la pluie digne d’un automne normand. L\u0026rsquo;entraînement et les efforts ont payé.\n  Read finira la course en 4h05’42”, une vraie machine de guerre. Je suis vraiment content d’avoir partagé ce moment avec lui, moi qui ait l’habitude de courir seul, c’était très cool de courir avec quelqu’un, et encore plus avec quelqu’un de sa trempe!\nMerci de m’avoir lu jusqu’ici, c’est quand même plus sympa d’écrire des rapports de “bonnes” courses! Que dire à part un énorme merci à toutes les personnes qui m’accompagnent et me soutiennent dans mes aventures, mes merveilleuses filles qui ont subi la pluie pendant la course, ma famille, mes amis, mes collègues (actuels ou anciens), mon coach Romain Guillaume, mes partenaires (Tacher Acogex, Culture Vélo Le Havre, Precision Fuel \u0026amp; Hydration), mon club le HAC triathlon, mon entreprise Doctolib et mon village de Mannevillette.\nEt encore et toujours la personne qui est toujours présente à mes côtés, et sans qui je ne serai que l’ombre de moi même 🩵 (encore qu’on a failli rater la course à cause du réveil!). Je le dis souvent, mais au-delà de la course et des entraînements, c’est toute une organisation et une logistique auxquelles il faut réfléchir pour que tout fonctionne, pour aller jusqu’à la course et surtout ne pas mettre en péril son couple. On fait vraiment équipe avec Audrey, et là plupart des actions que l’on met en place viennent d’elle. C’est le cerveau du groupe soyons honnêtes 😂 moi je suis les jambes et j’exécute.\nPour finir, la vie c’est comme les ascenseurs, il y a des hauts et des bas. Quand il y a des bas, il faut serrer les dents et redoubler d’efforts en attendant de remonter la pente. Quand il a des hauts comme aujourd’hui, il faut profiter du moment au maximum, avant le nouveau bas 😂\nDes stats! Un peu de statistiques et de données sur la course:\nNatation:\n Strava - Natation 28’55” 1’30”/100m 54 sTSS  Vélo:\n Strava - Vélo 2h15’50” Vitesse moyenne: 39,7km/h Vitesse maximum: 68,7km/h Puissance normalisée: 244 Watts Puissance maximale: 585 Watts Dénivelé positif: 708m 149 TSS  Course à pied:\n Strava - Course à pied 1h19’12” Allure moyenne: 3’47”/km (15,9km/h) Allure maximum: 3’15”/km (18,5km/h) Dénivelé positif: 201m 135 rTSS  Nutrition:\n Avant la natation:  1 PF\u0026amp;H caffeine gel 30g   Transition T1:  1 PF\u0026amp;H caffeine gel 30g   Vélo:  2 gourdes (1L chacune) avec 60g de PF\u0026amp;H mix (60g de glucides/1000mg de sodium) 1 PF\u0026amp;H caffeine gel 30g 1 PF\u0026amp;H gel 90g   Transition T2:  1 PF\u0026amp;H caffeine gel 30g   Course à pied:  1 PF\u0026amp;H gel 90g 1 soft flask (500mL) avec PF\u0026amp;H electrolytes (1000mg sodium)    Donc au total environ 109,7g de glucides, 731mg de sodium et 605mL d’eau par heure pour cette course. Pile ce que j’avais prévu et pratiqué à l\u0026rsquo;entraînement.\nJe vous laisse sur la vue qu\u0026rsquo;on avait sur le lac depuis notre maison finlandaise.\n  ","date":1693094400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1693094400,"objectID":"08dcbae43486c142f99469c372eb4036","permalink":"https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/ironman-lahti-2023/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/accomplishments/ironman-lahti-2023/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"Rapport de course de l'IRONMAN Lahti 2023","tags":["Triathlon","Ironman","Race"],"title":"Half IRONMAN World Championship Lahti - Finlande - 2023","type":"accomplishments"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"              Strava - Swim Strava - Bike Strava - Run  Where shall I start? 🤔 19th of July 2020, I finished my registration for IRONMAN Finland in August 2021, with in mind the goal of being much stronger than before, and also to finally finish a full IRONMAN. The one I did in Nice in 2019 was shortened due to the heat wave. I also had a secret goal of qualifying for the IRONMAN world championship in Hawaï, for which I had to be in the top 3 of my age group (30-34 years old). This was a bold goal, as I ranked 27th at Nice, a long away from the podium!\nI didn’t come up with this objective randomly. I knew I had a chance given what I thought I should be able to do with a decent training plan, and the statistics I analysed for other athletes who qualified the previous years. So I thought, why not?\nAnd it turned out… It was a success!\nTo cut a long story short, we ARE going to Hawaiï! I managed to finish second in my age group and 13th overall, way beyond my expectations. I had five sub goals when I arrived at the race:\n To swim less than an hour on the 3.8km (~2.3 miles) swim - I failed ❌ To cycle less than 5 hours on the 180km (~111 miles) bike race - Also failedl ❌ To run less than 3 hours during the marathon (26 miles) - Failed again❌ To qualify for Hawaiï - I succeeded ✅ To do an awesome race and be proud of myself - I succeeded ✅  Two out of five, not that good, the two most important ones are successes though. I almost managed to nail the other three too, so quite awesome overall! Here are some details about the race:\n Finish time 9h16’21” 2nd in my age group (30-34 years old) 9th man overall 13th overall (yeah the pro females are faster than me, they are SO impressive!) Swim 3.8km - 1h02’02”  1’38”/100m 34 strokes/min on average 47th overall (not so good)   Transition T1 - 2’54” Bike 180km 1200m D+ - 5h04’10”  35.51 km/h 200 Watts on average 211 Watts normalized power 220 TSS 59th overall (this is bad…)   Transition T2 - 2’14” Run 42km 400m D+ - 3h05’04”  4’24”/km 309 Watts on average 159 RSS 3rd overall (this is good!)    Still some work to do to improve swimming and biking, running is good enough. Let’s see what happened during the race.\nTraining plan and going to Finland This was in fact the most crucial part to perform correctly during the IRONMAN. One year of training and planning, trying to validate steps and improvements, all of this during several lockdowns. I definitely wanted to reach the next level on the bike and the swim, as I was pretty fed up of being largely beaten by other athletes. I knew my running was enough though, but it wouldn’t be enough to be on the podium!\nAnyway, my swim time during IRONMAN Nice was 1h01’, going for a sub 1 hour was in my reach. But, that assumption was in an ideal world without the Covid pandemic, that led to shutting down the swimming pools in October\u0026hellip;. I didn’t even have the time to re-start swimming seriously. However, I was super determined to do a good preparation, and even more determined to make it to the starting line with no regret and no excuse. It’d be too easy to say “I could have done better without the Covid”.\nSo I went to my parents to pick up an inflatable swimming pool, just deep enough to swim statically in it, and I set it up in my garden. It was just a matter of time before I had fixed a rope on the pole outside the swimming pool, tied that rope to an old inner tube (to get some sort of elasticity), then tied that tube to a belt around my waist, and here I was swimming ! It’s boring, it feels different , but at least I could train. With my wetsuit on obviously. I still wonder what my neighbors thought when passing by next to the house 😅\nQuick reminder on Norman weather in autumn and winter, it’s not that warm. The water in the pool slowly cooled down from 13 degrees to less than 5 starting in December. It was ok when it was around 10 to 13, but I had to put on gloves, neoprene socks, and an additional neoprene hooded vest when the water was between 5 and 10. And I swam for 15 to 20 minutes before I thought I would freeze to death! It was almost impossible to swim more than 15 minutes below 5 degrees. I don’t have enough fat on my belly 😁\nYour body loses its heat really rapidly when you are in cold water, and once it starts cooling down, all your blood goes to your vital organs, so no blood in your hands, feet, etc. Then it starts to really hurt. I am not usually the soft kind, I can handle pain, but it was really very painful. The worst being when you finally take a shower and the blood goes back to your hands. I am not ashamed to say that I actually screamed a couple times because of the pain 😅 such a pleasant experience.\nBut reap what you sow, so I would go back three times a week, not knowing if my swimming would improve, but at least I wouldn’t get worse.\nSo many months after, the swimming pools eventually opened again, it took a couple months to go back to my previous level. Since I was determined to have the best chance of succeeding, I thought it would be interesting to swim in open water too, as the swim race would be in a lake. But we don’t have lakes in Normandy, we have the sea, but it’s definitely not the same. So… I had a look on Google Maps, spotted two big ponds (around 200 meters long) next to the Château du Bec (a big medieval castle you can rent for weddings), and called the owner. I explained my plan to her and everything. She was really enthusiastic and told me to come and give it a go! Here I was, once or twice a week, walking down the castle enclosure with my wetsuit in my backpack to go for a swim in the lake. An amazing experience, I could get used to swimming with the wetsuit, swim in a straight line, not freak out when a fish came next to me or when I touched a stick floating in the water 😅 What a blast for a medieval fan like me!\nRegarding the bike, I had already made some improvements since the half IRONMAN world championships in Nice in 2019. The idea was to keep improving and also work a lot on the aero position, as I now have a real triathlon bike. Maintaining a good position is a real challenge when you have to keep it for several hours.\nApart from a couple of outside rides, I stayed indoors on the trainer, i.e. in my garage in front of a screen. Some workouts would be super intense but would last an hour, some would be easy but really long (4 to 5 hours). I spent quite a lot of Saturday mornings watching films, listening to some podcasts or music, reading books, etc.\nThe main advantage of the trainer is that your legs always have to push the pedals, so there’s no coasting during a workout (brief periods where you don’t pedal at all). That makes the workout much more time effective. Plus you don’t have to worry about the weather or the cars on the road.\nIn the end I went up to around 15 hours of training per week, which is quite a lot when you also want to spend time with your family and go to work! There’s always a moral contract your family and you have to agree on, otherwise you’re going to have some issues. All my workouts were in the calendar, including the time at which I would do them and how long they would last. I would share my feelings about my training, and make the necessary adjustments if needed, because life is not straightforward ! I also didn’t want triathlon to interfere with my life too much. My daughter doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about my training, she won’t ask if I’m tired, she just wants me to play and run after her 😁 that’s what it really takes to be an ironman !\nAnyway, here we are arriving in Finland, fully vaccinated, fully prepared for the race. Audrey and Livia are with me, we get to the house in the evening on Tuesday, the race is on Saturday. The wooden house is right next to a big lake in the middle of the forest, we definitely are in Finland! Three days to go to the athlete registration, do a quick bike ride on the roads we are going to race on, swim in the lake, check the legs can still run fast and drop the transition bags and the bike on Friday. We also made the most of that time to have some rest, it’s been a while since our last holiday!\nI could feel the stress mounting as the race day got closer. One evening, Audrey gave me a big envelope in which I discovered a TON of letters, drawings, cards, and cheerful messages from my family and friends. My sisters even made a special song just for me ! I will come back to it later on but I was really (REALLY) touched by all that love and I must say I cried a lot 😆\nRace day, finally, legs are burning from excitement, stomach filled up with breakfast. Audrey didn’t sleep well, but funnily enough I did 😆 Our daughter woke up on her own 15 minutes before departure, she’s a perfect little girly.\nWe jump in the car and go to the transition zone only five minutes away for home, super easy logistics for this IRONMAN! Last bike check up, I put all my drinks and food in the bags and on the bike, last mental visualisation of the transition to perform, and we walk to the start line. Weather is amazing, a clear blue sky with 17 degrees, it’s going to be a fine day.\nJust enough time to warm up a bit, put my wetsuit on, and give a last kiss to my daughter and wife. So much effort and training to be here, so many people behind me to support me, it’s finally happening. I turn to Audrey and say “I’m going to cry so hard if don’t focus” 😆 (I’m still trying to focus when writing the report!). I went to the starting line, started doing fist bumps to cheer on other athletes, this is going to be so awesome! In position, 3, 2, 1… BIP! All out now!\nSwim I jumped in the lake (turns out I just walked in the water when I had a look at Audrey\u0026rsquo;s video 😂, not so epic) and started swimming. Water was perfect (20 degrees), compared to the swimming pool in the garden in December, it’s heaven. It almost has a sweet taste, so much better than sea water. I scream in the water to let out some emotion, I am so happy to be racing!\nThat can seem a bit weird, but we are so filled up with adrenaline, hormones, and emotions that it has to come out one way or another. My arms felt good. Now I just had to wait for 3.8 km… It’s quite a long way when you swim, and since you can’t hear anything (your head is mostly below the surface), nor can you see (or really quickly when you take a breath), it tends to be a bit boring.\nI still made the most of it though, the lake and the landscape was beautiful, the sun was just above the treetops, I had almost no one around me so it was easy to relax and swim like during training.\nOut of the water in 1h02’, that’s 2 minutes behind schedule but I felt really fresh, as if I hadn’t swum at all, which is good because there was still 8 to 9 hours of race ahead. I ran to my bike, put on my helmet, bib, and socks and rushed through the exit, less than 3 minutes, very good. My bike shoes were already clipped on the pedals to save some time, I just had to slip my feet in and start pushing the pedals for the next 180 km!\nBike Riding your bike is fun, you can go fast, you see a lot of different landscapes, but most of the time it ends with a sore bottom.\nAfter a quick ride on the same road a couple days before, I was pretty confident I could ride the 180 km in less than 5h. It was not a technical road, it was long straight lines between the trees. So much different than in Nice where you had to really concentrate! It was never flat though. No big climbs or descents, but the real challenge was to handle the always changing road where you could hardly maintain a regular pace for more than a few minutes. On top of the undulating road, the trees and the lakes next to the road would create strange air masses, making it hard to understand why you would suddenly ride at 30 km/h in a descent and speed up to 45km/h in the next climb with a strong headwind. That was quite disturbing, so I focused on my wattage to stay in the power zones I knew I could hold for four or five hours.\nThe course was split into two 85 km loops, and connected to a 5 km (3.1 mile) segment towards the bike park. The weather was really nice, it was warm and sunny, and despite the strong wind on some portions, I enjoyed riding my bike! But even though I had made some significant improvements on the bike, I was still unable to compete properly with the other guys, which was a bit frustrating… But that was not enough to disturb me or make me diverge from my plan. An IRONMAN is first a race against yourself, trying to overdo it or following someone you don’t know nearly always ends up in failure.\nSo stick to the plan, and trust yourself. Speaking of plans, I also strictly followed my nutrition and hydration plans, with custom date bars and honey gels. When we think about sport, we most of the time think about the workouts. When it comes to endurance sports, and especially long races like an IRONMAN, nutrition and hydration are key! You simply cannot hold your pace for multiple hours without fuelling your body, that’s humanly impossible. And the more quality food you ingest, the better. You are not going to put standard gas in a race car right? Same goes for your body. It’s also better to eat the same things you are used to eating during training, because your gut becomes highly efficient to digest that food, the easier the better!\nA fine bike leg in the end, no mechanical issues, no sliding, nothing but strong riding through the middle Finland landscapes. It rained heavily for the last 20 minutes, the weather started to deteriorate unfortunately…\nI eventually reached the bike park after 5h04’, a bit behind schedule again, but I had to hold back during the last 40 km as my left thigh started cramping during climbs. And boy you are going to need that leg on the 42 km run race! The only thing I had in mind was to show the other athletes that even though they beat me on the bike, I would crush them on the run.\nRun I jumped off my bike and ran to my rack position, I emptied my shoes carefully, in which I put my nutrition for the run, that’s a pro tip to avoid forgetting something 😁 I then rushed through the bike park and started leaping like a stag. My legs felt a bit achy but that was the normal state after 5 hours of bike, I knew that wouldn’t prevent me from running fast. First kilometer done in 4’06” (almost 15 km/h), it didn’t feel like I was running, it felt so easy!\nI wanted to do a sub 3h marathon, so that meant staying at a 4’16”/km pace or lower. The course was quite technical, a lot of little climbs and descents on gravel roads or trails, not that easy! Maintaining a steady pace was again not possible, and there were almost zero entirely flat sections. But nevermind, legs are good!\nFour 10km loops for this course. One of the good things about being at the front of the race is that you’re on your own on the first laps, so you have all the supporters on the side of the road just for you! Especially the two best supporters of the world, my wife and daughter 😁 Even when they were out of sight, I could hear Audrey’s megaphone. I would then run proudly past them, waving and smiling at them. Hard not to cry and keep your composure to be honest!\nI am not the kind of athlete who remains concentrated and focused on the road in front of him, I like to enjoy the encouragement and thank the volunteers (even if it’s just a smile when you are gasping for air). It gives so much energy to share this moment, and not to mention that smiling makes the effort easier.\nAfter 25 km, pace was still steady and I had already overtaken most of those who had beaten me on the bike. I told you the race was not finished! Third lap ongoing, there were a lot of people on the course now as they had finished the bike leg.\nOne month before the race, I told Audrey that I was a bit afraid of the marathon, not about finishing it but rather being able to maintain the pace I had in mind. I feared I didn’t run enough kilometers. I would do 40 to 50 km per week, which is not a lot when considering a marathon training plan, but I thought that focusing on bike and swimming would be more beneficial. Well, it turned out I was right, the last 10 km were really tough! After 30 km, I could feel my thighs had become as hard as rocks, and they felt really achy. I didn’t feel like I didn’t have energy, just that my muscles were burnt. On top of that, it started raining, like heavy rain, we were all soaked to the bone.\nI then used one of the things for which I made a lot of improvements lately. It took me 30 years to realise how powerful emotions are, how to listen, understand and make the most of them. I would describe myself as cold blooded, that’s not the case anymore. During such a long race, you experience pain, suffering, motivation, despair, determination, euphoria and so many more emotions. What you do with them can totally change your race. I can’t remember how many times I finished some workouts in tears, because the intensity was so high and it would take all I had to go through the pain. But using emotions helps you go way further than what you think, where physical pain is no longer a limitation. It’s disturbing, you feel ridiculous for crying on your bike, but it feels so good!\nSo I used it all, all the emotions, the support from the people on the race, the shot of love and adrenaline each time I passed by my little family. The pace had slowed down a bit, my body was hurting and begging to stop, but I hanged on and thought about all my family and friends who were following the race on the IRONMAN tracker! There’s no way I will stop. 35, 36, 37, less and less kilometers to go, 38, 39, 40, last aid station, 41… one kilometer, just one to enjoy the present, the race that went almost according to plan, the feeling you gave it all.\nI couldn’t see the finish line yet but I was already crying. I sprinted through the last climb, I saw Audrey on the side next to the red carpet. My body was moving on its own, I barely remember these moments, I can only remember when I crossed the finish line, jumping and screaming my happiness.\nI met Audrey after the finish line, took my daughter in my arms, I was exhausted but so happy. One of the athletes who arrived just before me was in the same emotional state, he was French and we would later realise that on top of being a super nice guy, we were going to share the two first places on the podium, amazing.\nEven with the pace slowing down at the end, I did the 3rd time on the run with 3h05’, I said that was my specialty 😂 Time to rest now.\nThree days have passed since the race, the soreness is gone but I’m still a bit euphoric. I am really proud and pleased about my performance, and even more about my qualification to Hawaiï for the IRONMAN world championships.\nI cannot end this report without saying thank you a million times to all the people who were with me (even remotely) during that journey, my family and friends. All I can say is I love you, I am deeply happy to have such wonderful people in my life. I said it a lot of times to Audrey, it felt weird and I was embarrassed to receive so many messages just for me. I’ll say it again, I was really (really really) touched.\nI would also like to thank my running club LHSA, my local town Mannevillette and my employer Doctolib for supporting me in my adventures, and it’s not over yet! Thank you so much Nathalie for letting me swim in the Château du Bec lake, it\u0026rsquo;s been awesome! hank you again and again to Rosalie from LibreForme8, my nutrition angel 😊\nSee you in Hawaiï, aloha!\n","date":1629244800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629244800,"objectID":"3a089236fc086a20975046a91131f51e","permalink":"https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/ironman-finland-2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/accomplishments/ironman-finland-2021/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"Race report from IRONMAN Finland 2021","tags":["Triathlon","Ironman","Race"],"title":"IRONMAN Finland 2021","type":"accomplishments"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"       Strava - Run 1/2 Strava - Bike Strava - Run 2/2  One week after the Ventouxman, here I am again for another race for the Deauville Triathlon on Sunday the 27th of September. It hasn\u0026rsquo;t been long enough to recover from the previous race, but you couldn\u0026rsquo;t miss an opportunity to race in 2020 as so many races were cancelled. That one was originally scheduled in June (and postponed in September), and I chose to do the Olympic distance:\n 1500m Swim 40km Bike 10km Run  On arrête tout de suite avec les \u0026ldquo;ah mais c\u0026rsquo;est facile pour toi c\u0026rsquo;est super court comme format\u0026rdquo; 😑. Une fois pour toutes, ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas une question de distance mais d\u0026rsquo;intensité. L\u0026rsquo;intensité de l\u0026rsquo;effort diminue avec l\u0026rsquo;allongement de la distance 🤓, donc plus c\u0026rsquo;est court plus l\u0026rsquo;effort est violent, donc c\u0026rsquo;est loin d\u0026rsquo;être plus facile. Faites le test, courez tranquillement pendant 40 min et courez à fond pendant 10 min, on verra lequel est le plus cool 😛.\nBref, vu les conditions du week-end dernier j\u0026rsquo;espérais un peu de soleil, mais la Normandie n\u0026rsquo;était pas de cet avis. Du vent avec de bonnes rafales toute la semaine, un bonheur. Le samedi avait lieu d\u0026rsquo;autres formats de course à Deauville (une distance découverte et une distance L), et l\u0026rsquo;organisation a dû annuler la natation vu la hauteur des vagues dans la mer. On croise les doigts (🤞) quand même mais le beau temps n\u0026rsquo;est pas annoncé pour le dimanche, on verra.\nCe qui devait arriver arriva, arrivé sur place le dimanche, du vent et un peu de pluie, avec une mer toujours aussi houleuse, la natation est donc remplacée par de la course à pied (comme pour les autres épreuves), c\u0026rsquo;est donc le duathlon de Deauville finalement. Ce sera 3km de course à pied à la place de la nage. Ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas aujourd\u0026rsquo;hui que j\u0026rsquo;essaierai ma nouvelle combinaison (je désespère). Je me réjouis quand même, la course aura lieu, j\u0026rsquo;ai un car entier de supporters 🥰, je vais enfin faire une course avec Benjamin (depuis le temps), j\u0026rsquo;ai reçu mon nouveau vélo la veille (même si je sais pertinemment que ce n\u0026rsquo;est pas une bonne idée de l\u0026rsquo;utiliser si tôt, mais au moins je le sais 😅), et il fera moins froid que sur le Ventouxman.\nDépôt des affaires dans le parc à vélo (j\u0026rsquo;ai bien mon porte dossard? Oui 😅), il y a beaucoup de sables et de petites dunes qui se sont formées à cause du vent, ça va faire mal aux jambes pendant les transitions, et ça met surtout des grains de sables dans la transmission du vélo (et ça c\u0026rsquo;est mal, surtout sur un vélo tout neuf 😭). Le vélo de Benjamin est à quelques mètres du mien, et on rigole en disant qu\u0026rsquo;on va pouvoir mettre nos blagues en oeuvre. Le premier arrivé dans le parc à vélo pour la transition pourra:\n Enlever la selle Couper les lacets des chaussures Voler une des chaussures Dégonfler les pneus Cacher une barre énergétique dans une chaussure (ah non déjà fait) Etc.  On s\u0026rsquo;amuse comme on peut.\nDirection le départ sur la plage, avec les 500 premiers mètres de la course à pied dans le sable, génial! Je commence à m\u0026rsquo;échauffer sérieusement, le début de course va être assez rapide et je prévois de faire les 3km en 3'30\u0026quot;/km (environ 17km/h), pour ne pas laisser trop d\u0026rsquo;énergie avec le passage dans le sable et pour ne pas être trop fatigué sur le dernier 10km. L\u0026rsquo;organisation annonce l\u0026rsquo;ouverture des sas de départ pour dans quelques minutes, j\u0026rsquo;ai encore le temps. Les concurrents sont censés se placer dans les sas correspondant à leur niveau, afin que chacun y trouve son compte, mais on sait comment ça se passe 😅. Environ 15 secondes plus tard les sas sont ouverts (on a pas la même notion de \u0026ldquo;quelques minutes\u0026rdquo;), je me retrouve donc en pleins milieu de la foule, et je dois donc demander aux gens de se pousser pour pouvoir être dans les premières lignes. Parce que oui au bout d\u0026rsquo;un moment quand on s\u0026rsquo;entraîne on sait qu\u0026rsquo;on va avoir plus de monde derrière soit que devant, sans prétention bien évidement, et si on veut \u0026ldquo;faire sa course\u0026rdquo; et ne pas être gêné par les moins rapides, il faut se mettre devant. Sauf que le sas est petit et qu\u0026rsquo;il y a beaucoup de monde, je me retrouve avec une bonne centaine de personnes devant moi, et je n\u0026rsquo;ose pas leur demander pour passer devant 😓 Il faudra vraiment que je me fasse violence pour les prochaines courses.\nLe départ est donné (enfin pour ceux qui sont sur la première ligne 😓), 6 athlètes partent toutes les 6 secondes. C\u0026rsquo;est\u0026hellip; long. Quelques minutes plus tard je pars enfin. Le sable n\u0026rsquo;est pas trop mou donc on peut tout de même courir assez vite mais je reste prudent. Je double les gens que je n\u0026rsquo;ai pas osé doubler dans le sas, et on arrive sur le bord de plage, on peut enfin relancer. Il y a beaucoup de gens devant et je passe donc mon temps à slalomer pour doubler. Première partie finie en 12'57\u0026quot; à 3'36\u0026quot;/km de moyenne, un peu moins rapide que prévu mais le sable ralentit beaucoup, et au moins je n\u0026rsquo;ai vraiment pas eu l\u0026rsquo;impression de forcer.\nJ\u0026rsquo;attrape mon vélo et mon casque et m\u0026rsquo;extrais tant bien que mal des dunes pour rejoindre la sortie du parc à vélo, je saute sur ma selle et en avant! Le parcours vélo est assez technique avec de grosses bosses, pas un tracé que j\u0026rsquo;affectionne mais on fera de son mieux! J\u0026rsquo;avais prévu de faire environ 290 Watts de moyenne sur cette partie, puisque je savais que je pouvais tenir sur environ 1h et faire une bonne course après (cf la course virtuelle IRONMAN en Juin dernier). Première difficulté après 2km, la côte de Saint Laurent avec 1km à 15% (le col du ventoux c\u0026rsquo;est facile à côté), je garde les yeux sur mon capteur de puissance, 400 Watts\u0026hellip; tout va bien 😅 Certains cyclistes me dépassent, je me dis qu\u0026rsquo;ils sont soit vraiment bons grimpeurs, soit qu\u0026rsquo;ils font une erreur. Ambiance de folie pendant la montée, on se croirait au tour de France!\nJe relance après la côte et reprends ceux qui m\u0026rsquo;ont doublé (et qui ont apparemment du mal à reprendre leur souffle ah ah ah 😁), parcours vallonné comme prévu et peu de portions plates pour se mettre correctement dans la position aéro (c\u0026rsquo;est à dire les bras sur les prolongateurs), mais je suis quand même super content d\u0026rsquo;être sur mon nouveau vélo et dans une course!! Un des bénévoles m\u0026rsquo;indique je suis 50ème, c\u0026rsquo;est bien j\u0026rsquo;ai dépassé du monde.\nAprès 10km, j\u0026rsquo;ai des sensations bizarres dans les bras en position aéro, et je découvre en me relevant que les prolongateurs se sont desserrés, c\u0026rsquo;est chaud. Le gars du magasin de vélo m\u0026rsquo;avait dit que ce serait normal que les serrages bougent un peu au début avec du matériel tout en carbone. J\u0026rsquo;avais bien fait les réglages avant la course mais avec les dos d\u0026rsquo;âne et les trous dans la route c\u0026rsquo;était prévisible. Je me dis que ça va le faire, puis au bout d\u0026rsquo;un kilomètre je me dis que non, je vais finir par terre. Je m\u0026rsquo;arrête donc sur le côté, sors mon petit kit de réparation et resserre tout proprement. Je me dis que j\u0026rsquo;aimerai bien qu\u0026rsquo;il ne m\u0026rsquo;arrive aucune aventure pendant un triathlon, au moins UNE fois dans ma vie. Mais ça ferait des rapports de course moins sympa. Je repars avec plus de 2 min de perdue, je redépasse les gens que je venais de dépasser, et essaie de faire ma course correctement. Après 30km un des bénévoles me dit que je suis 30ème, c\u0026rsquo;est cool! La route est assez mouillée et il y a pas mal de feuilles par terre, il faut donc rester vigilant.\nLe reste du vélo s\u0026rsquo;est fait sans encombre, même si j\u0026rsquo;ai eu du mal à garder une allure stable. Les quelques bosses font vraiment mal aux jambes et j\u0026rsquo;ai l\u0026rsquo;impression que ça va impacter la course derrière, donc je reste sur la réserve. Bonne fin de parcours où nous étions 5 coureurs avec à peu près le même niveau en vélo, c\u0026rsquo;était cool! Dernière descente à plus de 80km/h 😨 et on arrive de nouveau sur la plage de Deauville. Je mange ma dernière barre énergétique à la datte (qui sera dans mon ventre et pas dans ma chaussure), elles sont vraiment très bonnes (et je les fais moi même, donc c\u0026rsquo;est encore meilleur). Beaucoup plus de supporters ici, j\u0026rsquo;entends ma mère me crier \u0026ldquo;Come on, that\u0026rsquo;s my boy!\u0026rdquo; 🥰🥰 et on remet un coup dans les pédales pour aller encore plus vite, parce qu\u0026rsquo;on est fier!\nJ\u0026rsquo;aperçois l\u0026rsquo;entrée du parc à vélo, je retire mes chaussures à l\u0026rsquo;avance, et je saute pied nus sur le sol en passant la ligne d\u0026rsquo;entrée du parc, 10/10 en style. Je rejoins mon emplacement en me disant que le parc est quasiment vide, c\u0026rsquo;est bon signe pour le classement. Je finis le vélo à 250 Watts de moyenne, donc loin des 290 Watts prévus, il faudra que je m\u0026rsquo;entraine plus sur des parcours de ce type.\nJe déboule sur la course à pied avec en tête une espérance de chrono de 35' sur les 10km, les jambes vont très bien mais il y a beaucoup de vent et des passages dans le sable, ça va être dur de tenir la cadence. Je pars en 3'40\u0026quot;/km (16,5km/h) et je commence à rattraper le peu de concurrents déjà sur la course à pied. Je passe devant mes supporters 😍 (encore plus motivés que moi!), ça fait chaud au coeur! Première boucle de 5km (sur deux) passée en 18'30\u0026quot;, l\u0026rsquo;allure est bonne malgré le vent. Deuxième passage devant les supporters (encore plus bruyants qu\u0026rsquo;au premier tour 😂), je rejoins un autre participant qui court à la même vitesse, et je décide d\u0026rsquo;accélérer sur le dernier kilomètre, j\u0026rsquo;ai décidément un peu trop géré la course 😐.\nJe termine la course à la 14ème place sur 1023, bon résultat malgré les erreurs que j\u0026rsquo;ai faites (mais qui font partie de la course), je sais maintenant que si je veux arriver près du podium, il faut prendre ses responsabilités. Bonne course dans l\u0026rsquo;ensemble, ce format n\u0026rsquo;est pas trop fatigant pour le corps donc ce sera un exercice à reproduire.\nUne fois encore merci à mes incroyables supporters que sont ma famille, ça semble évident mais les encouragements sont tellement puissants dans une course. Merci à mon entreprise Karhoo et mon club de course à pied le LHSA pour leur support, et toujours Rosalie de Libreforme8, qui m\u0026rsquo;a donné l\u0026rsquo;idée de ces supers barres énergétiques à la datte (entre autres!). Chapeau à Benjamin et à ses soeurs pour leur performance, ce fut un plaisir de faire cette course avec vous!\nIl est temps de se reposer maintenant, 2021 va être chargée!\n","date":1601337600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601337600,"objectID":"1cde406aabd698d3bc7cc6703981e9f2","permalink":"https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/deauville-2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/accomplishments/deauville-2020/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"Race report from the Deauville 2020 triathlon","tags":["Triathlon","Deauville","Race"],"title":"Deauville 2020 Triathlon","type":"accomplishments"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"        Strava - Bike Strava - Run  Une année est passée depuis mon dernier triathlon à Nice (pour les championnats du monde Ironman 70.3 à Nice), parce que occupés à être parents et qu\u0026rsquo;un virus a annulé toutes les courses.

L\u0026rsquo;objectif était surtout de voir où en était la machine et de prendre le départ avec l\u0026rsquo;un de mes meilleurs amis (Matthieu), ça rajoute du plaisir et des souvenirs!\nArrivés sur place la veille, le protocole anti Covid rend le dépôt des vélos plus rapide, au moins ça de gagné en énergie perdue à attendre. Mon emplacement vélo est juste à la sortie de la natation, juste à côté des vélos des pros 😁, bon point quand on sort de l\u0026rsquo;eau un peu étourdi! Dernière étape, dépôt du sac pour la course à pied, et pendant la conversation, Matthieu me parle du porte dossard, et là\u0026hellip; je m\u0026rsquo;exclame \u0026ldquo;J\u0026rsquo;ai oublié mon porte dossard à la maison le ***\u0026rdquo;. Matthieu rigole avant de se rendre compte qu\u0026rsquo;il l\u0026rsquo;a lui aussi oublié ah ah ah\u0026hellip; les deux gars super contents de faire la course ensemble et qui ne font pas bien leur sac. D\u0026rsquo;habitude je suis un vrai militaire sur la discipline et la logistique d\u0026rsquo;avant course, ça m\u0026rsquo;apprendra à me relâcher. Sauf qu\u0026rsquo;il nous en faut absolument un, on se rend dans les stands de la course, aucun porte dossard, on se dit donc qu\u0026rsquo;on va aller au Décathlon le plus proche. Il est pas loin c\u0026rsquo;est cool, je dis en rigolant à Matthieu \u0026ldquo;Ce serait drôle qu\u0026rsquo;il y en ait plus qu\u0026rsquo;un\u0026rdquo; ah ah ah. Ah ah ah\u0026hellip; 😅 parfois c\u0026rsquo;est bien de se taire. Je propose à Matthieu de se battre (en toute amitié) pour savoir qui aurait le porte dossard, mais il refuse en rigolant (parce qu\u0026rsquo;il sait très bien qu\u0026rsquo;il va perdre). On demande au vendeur s\u0026rsquo;ils n\u0026rsquo;en ont pas en stock, la réponse est non forcément. Direction le Décathlon à 20min de route, où on trouve enfin un autre porte dossard,sauvés! Que de stress et d\u0026rsquo;énergie perdue\u0026hellip; On rejoint la maison pour se détendre et préparer les affaires pour le lendemain, avec nos compagnes respectives et baby 🥰\nDépart de la course à 7h40, donc levés à 5h45, ce sera Pauline qui nous déposera sur le lieu du départ pour laisser baby dormir. Deux oeufs, oléagineux et un café, petit déjeuner typique d\u0026rsquo;avant course, et on prend la voiture. On se raconte qu\u0026rsquo;on a tous entendu l\u0026rsquo;orage pendant la nuit, il reste quelques grondements dans le lointain, mais la météo annonce juste un peu de pluie, pas très grave. Je préfère cette température que la canicule que l\u0026rsquo;on avait eu sur l\u0026rsquo;Ironman de Nice en 2019. Arrivée au parc à vélo, on regonfle les pneus, on prépare les affaires. Je rejoins Matthieu à son vélo et commence à mettre ma nouvelle combinaison de natation (que je vais ENFIN pouvoir utiliser dans une course). Et en même temps commence une douce pluie, qui se transforme quelques secondes plus tard en averse, obligés de s\u0026rsquo;abriter sous les arbres! Les éclairs zèbrent de plus en plus le ciel, et on compte les secondes entre la lumière et le son pour constater que l\u0026rsquo;orage se rapproche de nous, pas bon. L\u0026rsquo;heure du départ approche mais l\u0026rsquo;organisation temporise, en nous prévenant que l\u0026rsquo;orage devrait nous contourner. Vingt minutes plus tard l\u0026rsquo;organisation nous annonce qu\u0026rsquo;ils vont être obligés d\u0026rsquo;annuler la natation, l\u0026rsquo;orage ne se calme pas (la pluie non plus) et nager dans ces conditions est trop dangereux. Normal, mais extrêmement décevant! Le départ sera donc à 8h15, avec seulement du vélo et de la course à pied. Le problème est que nous avons tous déjà donnés nos affaires d\u0026rsquo;après course, nous sommes donc pour la plupart sous la pluie avec nos affaires de course déjà trempées, et que l\u0026rsquo;on refroidit assez vite. Quelques minutes plus tard, nouvelle annonce, les conditions au sommet du Mont Ventoux sont très dangereuses, orage, pluie torrentielle, vent à 100km/h et du brouillard, autant dire bien trop périlleux.\nLa décision est actée de réduire le vélo à 75km et d\u0026rsquo;emprunter la montée par Maleucène, et donc de ne pas monter jusqu\u0026rsquo;en haut du Ventoux, dommage. La pluie se calme (mais il pleut toujours), et le départ commence finalement à 8h30. De nombreux participants préfèrent abandonner avant le départ, il faut vraiment se faire violence pour oublier le froid actuel et les conditions de course qui nous attendent. Je grelotte de froid en m\u0026rsquo;approchant de la ligne de départ, je n\u0026rsquo;ai que ma trifonction (très fine) et mes manchons que j\u0026rsquo;avais prévu au cas où. Deuxième erreur de logistique, il faut tout prévoir pour une course en montage. Je passe devant Matthieu (les départ sont donnés par ordre de dossard croissant), et enfin les premiers coups de pédale, il est temps de se rechauffer un peu!\nJ\u0026rsquo;ai depuis peu un capteur de puissance sur mon vélo, qui me permet de très bien gérer mon allure. Pour les geeks des chiffres, j\u0026rsquo;avais prévu (avec l\u0026rsquo;aide du site bestbikesplit) de partir sur une moyenne de 250 Watts, que je savais pouvoir tenir plus de 3h et pouvoir faire une bonne course à pied derrière. Il fallait donc rester à 220 Watts sur les 50 premiers kilomètres puis monter à 280 Watts sur la montée du col. Je me cale donc à cette allure, bien posé sur mes prolongateurs. Les jambes ont bien progressé! Je roule entre 37 et 40 km/h sans difficulté, et je double beaucoup de monde. Les choses ont changé depuis Nice, je suis vraiment content! On enchaîne les routes assez plates, le début du parcours est vraiment roulant. J\u0026rsquo;arrive à rester calme bien que les jambes bouillonnent d\u0026rsquo;énergie. La pluie a un tout petit peu cessée, enfin. Première difficulté après 50km ça grimpe fort, je m\u0026rsquo;ajuste à 280-290 Watts et je me dis que ça passe facile. La pluie reprend de plus belle, encore plus fort qu\u0026rsquo;au départ.\nPremière (et dernière parce qu\u0026rsquo;il n\u0026rsquo;y a que de la montée) descente un peu technique, passage que j\u0026rsquo;affectionne particulièrement. Sauf que c\u0026rsquo;est impossible d\u0026rsquo;aller vite, l\u0026rsquo;eau tombe tellement fort qu\u0026rsquo;il y a un torrent sur la route, je me prends beaucoup d\u0026rsquo;eau dans les yeux avec la pluie qui tombe et l\u0026rsquo;eau qui remonte des pneus, mes yeux sont réduits à deux petites fentes, et la visibilité est vraiment réduite. Pour courronner le tout, mes jantes en carbone (qui n\u0026rsquo;offrent déjà pas un super freinage) donnent l\u0026rsquo;impression de freiner dans le vide, je suis obligé d\u0026rsquo;anticiper plus de 100m à l\u0026rsquo;avance pour éviter de me retrouver dans le décors. Pas grave, c\u0026rsquo;est le jeu!\nOn attaque enfin le plat principal, la montée par Malaucène. J\u0026rsquo;ai choisi de ne pas regarder mon compteur de kilomètre pour rester concentré sur les watts, je n\u0026rsquo;ai donc aucune idée d\u0026rsquo;où est l\u0026rsquo;arrivée, mais ça m\u0026rsquo;aide à rester dans le présent. On grimpe, on grimpe, la pluie n\u0026rsquo;arrête toujours pas de tomber, ça ressemble plus à du kayak que du vélo. Je suis plutôt bien, les jambes sont ok, j\u0026rsquo;ai chaud et je me nourris régulièrement. Sauf que quand on grimpe, la température descend, et on grimpe\u0026hellip; doucement.\nVers la moitié de la montée, je me rends compte que mes doigts sont plus proches du bleu que du blanc, et j\u0026rsquo;ai l\u0026rsquo;impression d\u0026rsquo;avoir les bras et les pieds engourdis. Pas vraiment une impression puisque 10min plus tard je me dis que je commence vraiment à avoir froid, alors que je monte toujours à 290 Watts (environ 90% de ma FTP, donc grosse intensité). Je vois le camion de la croix rouge passer, je pense que certains font de l\u0026rsquo;hypothermie. Quelques kilomètres plus haut, mon souffle fait de la vapeur d\u0026rsquo;eau avec le froid et la pluie, et je n\u0026rsquo;ai vraiment plus aucune sensation dans les pieds et les mains. J\u0026rsquo;ai l\u0026rsquo;impression d\u0026rsquo;être en Normandie en plein hiver! La course se corse un peu, mais je vois une borne sur le côté indiquant la fin de la montée dans 5km, ouf! Quelques coups de pédales plus tard je vois l\u0026rsquo;entrée du parc de transition, et je suis obligé de m\u0026rsquo;arrêter avant la ligne pour déchausser, impossible de desserer mes chaussures avec les doigts gelés. Je cours tant bien que mal jusqu\u0026rsquo;à mon emplacement, je tremble de froid et j\u0026rsquo;ai du mal à calmer ma respiration. C\u0026rsquo;est la première fois de ma vie que j\u0026rsquo;ai aussi froid (et pour ceux qui me connaissent j\u0026rsquo;ai globalement toujours chaud). Je change de chaussures avec quelques cris de douleurs, et je m\u0026rsquo;élance pour la course à pied.\nLes 20km ont été réduits à 15km, donc seulement 3 tours de 5km. Première expérience de course à pied avec les pieds et les jambes gelées, franchement à éviter 😅 j\u0026rsquo;ai l\u0026rsquo;impression d\u0026rsquo;être Forest Gump avec ses armatures métalliques lorsqu\u0026rsquo;il était petit. Mon souffle est toujours saccadé, je tremble pendant que je cours et mes jambes sont tellement froides qu\u0026rsquo;elles se contractent erratiquement, et surtout douloureusement. Je suis obligé de faire des tous petits pas pour éviter les crampes et les douleurs. Bonne nouvelle par contre, le parcours est vraiment très cool, et le peu de coureurs m\u0026rsquo;indiquent que je dois être assez bien placé! 5km plus tard la chaleur revient enfin, et je peux enfin reprendre une vraie foulée. Je redouble les participants qui m\u0026rsquo;avaient doublés pendant mon tour de (ré)chauffe, je vais pas me laisser abattre! Passage du premier tour sous les encouragements d\u0026rsquo;Audrey, Pauline et baby, ça ravigote! Deuxième tour avec de biens meilleurs sensations, et surtout une sensation étrange dans la chaussure gauche, parce que j\u0026rsquo;ai l\u0026rsquo;impression qu\u0026rsquo;elle est pleine de terre (logique puisque l\u0026rsquo;on court dans la boue). Puis je réfléchis et me souviens que pour préparer les transitions, je mets dans mes chaussures ce dont j\u0026rsquo;aurai besoin pour éviter de fouiller dans le sac. Je compte les barres énergétiques que j\u0026rsquo;ai dans ma poche dorsale (dattes et noix de cajou 🤤, une, deux\u0026hellip; Où est la troisième? Voilà voilà, c\u0026rsquo;est donc de la datte que je sens entre mes doigts de pied, et que je vois ressortir par les mailles de la chaussure, classe. Une bonne histoire à raconter.\nTroisième et dernier tour, je déroule et je me sens bien, un quatrième tour ne m\u0026rsquo;aurait pas dérangé, même dans ses conditions. Je suis quand même content d\u0026rsquo;en terminer, le froid m\u0026rsquo;a vraiment fait mal. Je passe la ligne en 4h19 et finis en 49ème position. Nous étions 850 inscrits, seulement 530 ont terminé (entre les non partants et les abandons, c\u0026rsquo;est l\u0026rsquo;hécatombe). Le niveau devant était vraiment élevé, j\u0026rsquo;aurai peut être gagné quelques places sans le froid, mais je pense que je suis à ma place. J\u0026rsquo;attends l\u0026rsquo;arrivée de Matthieu, qui a l\u0026rsquo;air vraiment serein, il a vraiment progressé aussi, c\u0026rsquo;est top!\nUne super expérience malgré les conditions dantesques, mon seul regret est de ne pas avoir pu profiter du paysage, parce qu\u0026rsquo;on ne voyait absolument rien. Apparement je n\u0026rsquo;ai pas été le seul à avoir quelques mésaventures, puisque Matthieu a crevé. Après 5km de course 😆 Il faudra revenir! Place à la récup et à la prochaine course le week-end prochain (avec un PORTE DOSSARD!).\nEnorme merci à nos supportrices (😍😍), à mon entreprise Karhoo pour son support, à mon club de course à pied le LHSA, et toujours Rosalie de Libreforme8, pour ses conseils si efficace pour ma nutrition et mon hydratation. Et surtout merci à Matthieu d\u0026rsquo;avoir fait cette course avec moi, un super moment de partage.\n","date":1600646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600646400,"objectID":"09c479a66b84cc5334fce255084448e1","permalink":"https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/ventouxman-2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/accomplishments/ventouxman-2020/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"Race report from the Ventouxman 2020 triathlon","tags":["Triathlon","Ventoux","Race"],"title":"Ventouxman 2020","type":"accomplishments"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"How I raced my first ironman\n","date":1569110400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569110400,"objectID":"150f5d01f6ac7e2b33916927db0068f1","permalink":"https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/ironman-703-wc-2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/accomplishments/ironman-703-wc-2019/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"A race report from the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship 2019 in Nice","tags":["Triathlon","Ironman","Race"],"title":"IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship 2019 - Nice","type":"accomplishments"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"How I raced my first ironman in Nice\n  ","date":1561852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561852800,"objectID":"4bc03b7bea92040a587dad43b96e7fdb","permalink":"https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/ironman-nice-2019/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/accomplishments/ironman-nice-2019/","section":"accomplishments","summary":"A race report from the IRONMAN Nice 2019","tags":["Triathlon","Ironman","Race"],"title":"IRONMAN Nice 2019","type":"accomplishments"}]
