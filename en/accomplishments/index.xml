&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;little-reminder&#34;&gt;Little Reminder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, jet lag! It’s 4 a.m., and I’m struggling to fall asleep. Well, not struggling, really – I just can’t sleep at all, haha.
We returned from Hawai&amp;rsquo;i five days ago now, and I’m finding it a bit difficult to get back to a stable sleep pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our daughters are coping a bit better, despite a few middle-of-the-night wake-ups. But children adapt faster than we do.
And Audrey… apparently not affected by jet lag – she’s so annoying 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, we were already in Hawai&amp;rsquo;i for the same reason: the IRONMAN World Championship.
While there were many similarities with this trip, the adventure didn’t go so well that time.
I’ll spare you the details (since it’s all written &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/im-wc-hawaii-2022&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; anyway), but I had to withdraw from the race during the swim.
The next day, I told my wife something like, “The island has won; I’ll never finish the Hawai&amp;rsquo;i IRONMAN.”
To which she replied that I couldn’t let it end on that failure and that I’d regret it for the rest of my life.
She was right, of course (have I mentioned she’s almost always right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we got back to work, and in the meantime, so much happened again.
I qualified again for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i (because otherwise, I wouldn’t be writing this report) at IRONMAN Florida, where I took 🥈 in my age group.
I then raced at IRONMAN Austria this past June to prepare for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i, where I took 🥇.
I knew I was in good shape, but I didn’t expect to take such a sweet revenge on this course (I’d had to withdraw the year before due to a recurring heel issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-coaching&#34;&gt;Mental Coaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started a journey I should have embarked on a long time ago: I took care of my head.
No, I didn’t go to the hairdresser, but I made an appointment with a psychologist and mental coach, Laure Calviac.
By a twist of fate, my manager at Doctolib (hi, Flo!) mentioned a partnership our company has with Moka Care, a mental health prevention platform.
He told me that each employee gets four free sessions with any mental health professional, no matter the issue.
Perhaps it was destiny giving me a little nudge, but I found the right person and started my first session the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s honestly (REALLY) fascinating! I won’t bore you with the details of my life (even though I sort of am by writing this),
but there’s so much to explore and understand in your own mind. Sure, the initial focus was on athletic performance, but that’s inherently
linked to our psychology. Many sessions ended up delving into life events that shaped me as both a man and an athlete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental profiling, imagery, visualisation, confidence anchoring, mindfulness, cardiac coherence –
these are just a few of the tools you learn to use to be at your mental best on race day (and in training, and ultimately, in life 🤣).
For anyone interested, I could talk about this for hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unlocked so much in my mind in such a short time, thanks to Laure’s work. Thank you! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;osteopathy-and-contracture&#34;&gt;Osteopathy and contracture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve also set up regular check-ups every three months or so with Pierre-Antoine (whom you obviously know), my physiotherapist/osteopath.
When you train almost every day (well, every day except for rare exceptions), it’s crucial to address minor aches as quickly as possible
and anticipate tensions that build up over time (for instance, due to a heel operation – haha – or a weakness in my ribs that sometimes pop out – haha).
The advantage of regularly seeing your osteopath is that they get to know you really well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every session, he releases my left ankle, rebalances my diaphragm, and relaxes my back (especially where my ribs popped out that one time!).
Thank you for your work, Pierre-Antoine – it’s definitely helped me avoid major injuries.
Because, let’s be clear, the top priority in triathlon (and in all sports, really) is not getting injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a fright with my calf at the beginning of September – a nasty muscle cramp during a run that was nothing out of the ordinary.
It was the first time in my life I’d experienced a cramp like that, and to be honest, I didn’t even know what it was.
I took it easy in the days that followed, thinking it was just muscle fatigue like soreness,
but it didn’t go away at all – to the point where I couldn’t run anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to worry a bit, so I did some research online (don’t pretend you’ve never done the same – I know you!).
I realised it was very likely a muscle contracture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contracture is the body’s self-protection mechanism: when it senses a muscle is about to tear,
it contracts that muscle very tightly and prevents it from relaxing to avoid injury. It basically means rest and relaxing the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit, I had a moment of doubt. I couldn’t sleep that night, picturing having to cancel Hawai&amp;rsquo;i because of a muscle tear
(which would take a good three weeks to heal) 🤦. But in the middle of the night, I used my mental preparation tools,
planned out my next steps for the following day, and calmed myself down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I called my favourite physio, Antoine, and my sister Emilie
(who’s now a sports doctor as well as a gynaecologist – and I’ll admit, the sports medicine part is much more relevant to me!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Antoine was on holiday, so it was Victor (who works in the same practice as Antoine – and Pierre-Antoine too, for that matter; hope you’re keeping up!)
who stuck a tiny needle into my calf to release the tension. And it worked perfectly – three days later, the pain was gone,
and I could get back to training without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s so reassuring to have such great medical support – thank you, team! 🙏&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arrival&#34;&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the point – here we are, ready to head off to the Big Island again. We’re acclimatised to the heat (despite the dreadful weather we had in Normandy in September). This time it’s even better: we’re travelling with our two daughters, my sister Emilie, and also Lyséa, our niece (her trip to Hawai&amp;rsquo;i is her 18th birthday present – not bad, right?), along with Jason, my sister’s partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, we’ll be meeting up there with Adrien Boullier and his family. He’s my mate from HAC Triathlon, and he’s qualified for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i too (for the fourth time – he’s a regular 😅).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous trip was… eventful, to say the least – problem after problem. But this time went so smoothly it’s barely worth mentioning. Then again, we’re starting to get used to travelling, so logistics aren’t much of an issue anymore. That said, just to show it wasn’t entirely easy, Emilie and Jason were a bit short on time arriving at the airport and made it “just” 20 minutes before boarding. It was a close call!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girls were adorable on the flight. Sure, Pénélope climbed on the seats a bit, but she’s only two and a half – poor thing, it’s a long journey to Hawai&amp;rsquo;i. I think the worst of it was for Jason, though, who’s not exactly a fan of flying (yep, I’m calling him out, and I’m not done yet!).&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-avion&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-9.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Kona like seasoned pros. Audrey and Emilie went to pick up the vehicles, while the rest of us handled the luggage – not a drop of sweat shed. We headed to our accommodation in Waikoloa, the same place as two years ago. It’s slightly removed from the hustle and bustle of the race, and it’s absolutely perfect for the kids. Honestly, we almost had the confidence of people who go to the same place every year 🙄.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting to the time difference was a bit tricky (for me and the girls, not Audrey, of course), but everything’s fine! The first training sessions felt a bit sluggish – no surprise after over 20 hours of travel – but I’m feeling calm. I’ve prepared well, both physically and mentally, for this event, and I trust in my preparation. I realised how different things are compared to last time, and I think I mentioned more than once to those around me that it feels like a completely different person will be lining up at the start this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed paths with some pros during training – it’s so cool! It’s funny to find yourself right next to the guys you watch on YouTube at home 😀.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did part of a cycling session with Adrien – just enough time to chat a bit and take a photo to make everyone at the club jealous! It’s so awesome to share this experience with him 🤗.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-adrien&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-12.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-12.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the most of the island, the beach, and the ocean – the water’s warmer than when we go to the pool in France! We even went swimming with manta rays at night (one of the most incredible experiences of my life). In short, living the dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off, my coach, Romain Guillaume, joined us three days before the race! He hadn’t been sure if he could make it, but with three of his athletes competing in the IRONMAN, he booked his tickets at the last minute. I offered him the sofa bed, so there he was, showing up on Wednesday night 🤣. We’ve been working together for two years, but this was the first time we met in person. And what better way to make a first meeting unforgettable than on the other side of the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of what he’s like, he did the IRONMAN Malaysia three weeks earlier (competing in the pro category, even though he’s technically “retired”), flew back to France, and then almost immediately set off again for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i. It felt like he barely slept, yet we were running, swimming, and he was preparing training plans for his other athletes. He’d head out at 6 a.m. in Kona to meet his sponsors and so on. He seems to know everyone there – you couldn’t walk 20 metres without him bumping into someone he knew. Absolutely incredible 🤣. Bursting with energy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The girls also got to have their own race – a 400-metre run along the ocean, complete with a commentator, supporters, and even a lady dressed as a unicorn 🤷.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penny was a bit scared (which is totally normal at two and a half with all that noise!), but Livia ran the whole race. She really did run, even with her little five-year-old legs – I had to run too just to keep up with her! It was SO much fun 🤣. Of course, I’m pretty sure what they enjoyed most was the aid station at the finish line, with crisps, cookies, apple juice, and sweets. Given how much they ate, you’d think we don’t feed our girls 🙄.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;d-day&#34;&gt;D Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then race day arrived. I didn’t have any trouble sleeping, no issues with waking up (unlike in Finland 🤣), and Rom even jumped into bed to finish waking me up (he jokingly said he would do that the night before, but it turned out he wasn’t joking!). There’s not much to say – we’re getting pretty good at organising race mornings. I think the hardest part was for Jason, who’s not too keen on early mornings. Poor guy 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed to the start line. I felt calm, just like I did before the IRONMAN Austria start, which is a good sign. Audrey showed off her driving skills – I’m glad Rom got to witness that 🤣.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final hug and kiss for everyone, Audrey said something to me but I was a bit spaced out (I’ll need to ask her later what she said). I wasn’t distracted, just focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about doing Hawai’i again is that the organisation is pretty much the same! I remembered a little hidden corner with two toilets where no one goes (please keep this secret, and by the way, I’m not going to tell you exactly where they are), perfect for a pre-race pee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to go back to the tattoo tent to put a tattoo (or a “touatouage” as Penny would say 🤗 ♥️) on my second arm. Normally, Audrey does my tattoos (which is just the race number) in the morning, but this time for some reason, I felt like I had wings and decided to do it myself. I forgot to peel off the protective film, so the tattoo was useless… I got told off. Anyway, back to the tattoo tent, the volunteers were super nice, we had a little chat, and the lady struggled to get the ‘4’ the right way round. She missed three times in a row, so the ‘4’ ended up half stuck on, and had to be removed each time with alcohol and a bit of scraping – free waxing, in a way. In the end, she wrote it with a marker 🤣. (If you look closely at my right arm in the race photos, you’ll see the ‘4’ is in marker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed to the bike park, where we were greeted by a row of volunteers (at least fifty of them) who cheered us on and wished us good luck for the race – it was really moving 🥹.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my bike, pumped up the tyres (we deflate them the day before to prevent them from bursting in the heat), but I had a doubt about my rear tyre as it hadn’t inflated like usual. I figured it was probably just because it wasn’t my usual pump (they provide bike pumps). I finished setting up my helmet, shoes, and nutrition (two one-litre bottles of water with 240g of carbs and two PF&amp;amp;H 1000 packets each, one bottle of water with one PF&amp;amp;H 1000 packet (electrolytes), three PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gels, and one PF&amp;amp;H gel). That’s quite a bit of sugar! As Emmanuel, one of my colleagues, once said, given the amount of food I carry, should I be considered a food truck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked my rear tyre again, and the pressure hadn’t changed, so all was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed for the start line, saw all the pros ready to enter the water. They start at 6:30, and my wave is at 6:45, so not too much time to wait. I put a good amount of anti-chafing cream everywhere (because swimming in salty water doesn’t help!), took a gel, finished my bottle of water and electrolytes (we avoid a repeat of earlier dehydration this season). In races like this where it’s very hot, we can do “preloading.” This means drinking more water than usual the day before and the morning of the race, adding electrolytes (sodium + potassium) so the water stays in the body. Honestly, having an extra litre of water already in me and being sure I’m well hydrated is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put on my speedsuit (the swimming suit, not the neoprene one that helps with buoyancy, as it’s not allowed here due to the warm water, but the one with a hydrophobic coating) and headed to my starting slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten how amazing the atmosphere is at this race! To be honest, I think I was so tense the last time that I was oblivious to everything around me. The start is on the street by the sea, so there isn’t much space, and with the crowd, it gets really packed. People are cheering us on, high-fiving – we almost feel like pros 🤣.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waved to Adrien’s partner and his girls, searched for Audrey for a bit but couldn’t find her, then moved into the start slot. I bumped into Victor, with whom I was on the podium at IRONMAN Florida, and we’d agreed to meet in Hawai’i. I was so happy to see him! We chatted for a few minutes, then both went back into our pre-race focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear the pros start, and a few minutes later, it’s our turn to enter the water. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a shot of adrenaline just writing this – I’m ready to race again! The water is warm, unsurprisingly, between 28 and 29 degrees. The (virtual) starting line is about 100 metres from the shore, so we swim out to it. We end up in the ocean with around 300 guys in a tight group, no standing (good thing we know how to swim 😅), and the organisers’ paddlers take turns in front of us to prevent us from going further. Naturally, with 300 guys full of energy, we’re not sure whether we’re swimming in water or testosterone, and we start drifting past the starting line. The guys on the paddles shout at us to move back, then begin raising their paddles shouting “BACK UP! BACK UP!”… it’s tense 🤣.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funniest part is when we started feeling slimy things under our hands. We were in the middle of a jellyfish swarm, the size of a big grapefruit but with long filaments. And, being boys, we started joking around, which quickly turned into jellyfish throwing. It was like a throwback to my football years when I was 10, throwing worms at each other while waiting for our turn to take a shot at goal, and painting ourselves with mud for warpaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with these jellyfish was their filaments… which sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got stung on the thigh, foot, and hand, and honestly, it hurt 😓. I heard later that a few athletes had to drop out of the race because of the stings, tough luck for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, everyone is super motivated, and when the cannon goes off, we’re off at full speed. We push a bit at the start, but more to carve out our space, and even though we take and give a few hits, the swimming goes pretty smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled a bit at first to get into the right rhythm, but I feel like I’m swimming well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about ten minutes, I do a quick internal check of my body, and everything is fine. My ribs are in the right place, I’m not in any pain, and my mindset is solid. I have flashes of my thoughts from two years ago, and it makes me a bit sad, but today I have confidence, and I’m not going to fail. I pass the turnaround point (after 1.9km), marked by a big boat, and I feel strong, and a few meters later I think to myself, “I’ve never gone this far in the race before” 🤣 I glance over at the guys on the paddles, expecting to see the man who had helped me on that day, but he’s not there 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the rest of the swim goes well, the group has spread out, so it’s easier to swim, and I’m feeling good. I stay cautious and keep my energy for later, there are still a few kilometers after I get out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later heard that there were dolphins in the water while we were swimming, and they weren’t far from us. I didn’t get the chance to see them, that would have been magical. It would have been even more magical to see the sharks that the dolphins had just chased away, and that the organisers were keeping an eye on, haha&amp;hellip; There’s very (very) little chance that the sharks would come and bite our toes (at worst, I’d throw a jellyfish at them!), but still, it’s a bit scary!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get out of the water in 57&#39;03 (I’d aimed for 57&amp;rsquo;, so I’m right on target), the atmosphere is amazing, I run to grab my transition bag, quickly take a gel while putting on my leg sleeves (for aerodynamics AND also to protect myself from sunburn), and I run to my bike. I put on my helmet, stash a few gels in the pockets on my back, check my rear tire (it’s properly inflated!), put on the lucky bracelet that Paola made for me, and I mount my bike after exiting the transition area. Of course, my shoes are already clipped onto the pedals and held in place by elastic bands so I can slip my feet in while I pedal. No time to waste in transition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And off we go for 180km of cycling. After about 50 meters, the first hill begins, with hordes of spectators. I smiled because I was truly happy to be there, feeling strong, in the sun, on my bike, at the World Championships!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the course is through the city, and I get to see my whole family twice; the girls are gorgeous ♥️ The megaphone is out, and it’s full of energy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we go on the Queen K, the &amp;ldquo;highway&amp;rdquo; of Kona. It’s almost 90km in one direction to Hawi in the north of the island, where we turn around and come back. Simple, brutal, and unforgiving. No shade, volcanic rock all around, and a mix of climbs and descents. Nothing crazy, but it’s draining. The only real change is the climb to Hawi, which is quite long, and where we face a strong headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;source src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-video-8.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain quite cautious on the way out, I could feel right from the start of the bike that I wasn’t having my best day, the target watts (240 watts) felt a bit challenging, while it should have been relatively comfortable at the start. Sometimes you have a lingering fatigue, sometimes it’s the body conserving energy, I’m not sure how to interpret it, but I know that even if the legs are not at their best, the mind will do what it takes. And even if it’s not the expected performance, you have to do your best with what you have on the day! So I keep it between 220 and 230 watts, and Rom advised me to stay calm on the way out and push a bit more on the way back. Anyway, it’s still moving fast, and to my delight, the other athletes are following the drafting rule well. I’ve never seen so many referees (on motorcycles). I even spotted them using their stopwatch to check that overtaking times were being respected, which is great! (NB: when passing another competitor, the overtaking must be completed within 25 seconds, otherwise, you receive a penalty card).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a bottle of water at each aid station to splash cold water on my head and body because even if the weather is overcast, it’s still hot! It’s easy to get a false sense of relief on the bike because you’re riding, so you have air flowing, but you need to stay cautious, otherwise, dehydration will catch up on the marathon. I reach the climb to Hawi after 90km with an average of over 39km/h, it’s fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb is quite long, and I can really feel that I’m not in the best shape at all, struggling to push over 280 watts, so I lose some time, but the morale is good. After a final long uphill stretch into a headwind, I reach the turnaround (the only technical part of the race, really 🤷), and we head back to Kona! It’s more than 10km of descent with the wind at my back, averaging nearly 55km/h, faster than a scooter, ah ah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return was… long! I felt the heat, especially on the head, not overly, but the water bottles at aid stations were always welcome. I followed my nutrition/hydration plan to the letter, so I was sure I wouldn’t hit a low point. But the watts were so tough to maintain! The last 60 kilometers were into a headwind again, and as spaces opened up, you end up pretty much alone on that long straight line. Riding straight with my head in the aerobars doesn’t bother me at all, thankfully because the course is quite monotonous. At least we ride with the ocean and volcanoes in the background. We also cross wild goats and donkeys, quite the sight 🤣.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often see less than 200 watts on my watch, which isn’t great, but I keep going. And I feel like I’m “sticking” to the road towards the end, like when you have big MTB tires. The end of the bike course is approaching, and we start passing the pros who are already on the marathon, and the Kona vibe is back — it’s so cool! I take off my shoes about 200m before the bike dismount zone, and I do a little graceful jump (at least I think so, though it may not have been graceful at all) to start running before the line, and then I’m back in the transition area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 4 hours and 50 minutes with an average speed of 37.3km/h, I give my bike a little farewell kiss and run towards the transition tent. That’s when I realize three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The volunteers are still on top of their game in the park, and I feel like a world champion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s hot, like really, really hot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My legs feel terrible, usually by the time I hit the marathon, I’m like “yay, it’s the marathon” and I don’t feel my legs at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit down in the tent to put on my running shoes, and have a little fright when a volunteer puts a cold towel around my neck to cool me down — totally didn’t see that coming! 🤣 He apologized, I did too, and we laughed about it. I told him I’d love a second one because it felt so good! I place my Team GB headband (which my big sister lent me, a headband she got as part of her gear for the 2012 Olympics 😎) under my cap to keep the sweat out of my eyes. I grab my nutrition and off I go for the marathon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, I have to control myself to not go out too fast, but today… I’m struggling. My stomach hurts, and my legs are begging me to slow down. It’s going to be a long one. But I remind myself that this could pass, just like in Austria where I felt totally wrecked after the bike, and two kilometers in, I was running like a gazelle and finished the marathon in 2:57, so patience is key!&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-8.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 10 kilometers were… long. My usual IRONMAN strategy (which comes from my coach, of course) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First 10 kilometers, take it easy, stay just below the threshold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next 20 kilometers, hit the planned pace and maintain it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last 10 kilometers, give whatever&amp;rsquo;s left.
Usually, I start feeling the pain in my legs around 25-30 kilometers, but the marathon is generally well-managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategies work well when everything goes according to plan, but today, I had to improvise! I was clearly struggling from the very first kilometer, and had to push a bit to maintain my pace. Still, I kept going, but the sensations stayed the same: 4:11 for the first kilometer, then 4:15, 4:17, 4:19, and 4:46 at the 6th kilometer. I started to doubt myself. 36 kilometers left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the course was along the coast, and it was suffocating. It was very humid, and there wasn’t even a breeze. Honestly, I thought to myself, “DNF is coming!” I gave myself 5 minutes to complain, and after that, I called on all my mental tools to get back on track. Even when it’s tough, I reminded myself to stay positive. I had already completed the bulk of the race, I could still run, I wasn’t in hypoglycemia or dehydration, and even though I had given up on aiming for a great time, I could keep going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, I cross paths with Audrey and all my supporters, except my sister, who had gone much further along the course. No need to tell Audrey how I’m feeling — she knows me well enough to see from my face and stride that I’m not in the best shape. A few minutes later, I cross paths with Rom (my coach), and I tell him my stomach hurts. He says, “The race isn’t over, be patient, and stay positive.” Good, I had just told myself the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 10-12 km, we arrive on the Queen K (again), with a little less humidity but still rather hot conditions, especially with the tarmac! They recorded 92% humidity and 52 degrees at ground level. Luckily, we have shoes on. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s straight ahead, with an alternation of slight uphill and downhill stretches, and you just have to switch off your brain. For the rest of the marathon, it will be a rollercoaster of sensations, one kilometre in 4:15 and the next in 4:40, making it impossible to maintain a consistent pace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s cool is that I ran into some pros who were on their way back from the marathon, and honestly, judging by some of their faces, it was (very, very) tough for everyone. The marathon has aid stations every 2 kilometres, and that&amp;rsquo;s just about right! Each station is filled with ice, and you mustn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to pour ice into your tri-suit and under your cap. It&amp;rsquo;s so hot that I can barely feel the ice, and it melts before the next aid station because my body is so hot. Missing one is risking heat stroke and having to DNF. It&amp;rsquo;s a race against the heat, and you have to constantly stay soaked to try to cool down. I drank over 15 litres of water during the race, and I think I still lost a few kilos. To make things worse, we often get water in our shoes, which tends to give me blisters from the rubbing. But hey, that&amp;rsquo;s the least of our problems 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who do I hear shouting in the middle of the Queen K? My sister 🤣 She came all the way to cheer me on, even though there was no one else except at the aid stations. Rom had laughed when she said the day before, “I’m going to meet you at the 35-kilometre mark,” because he didn’t think she’d actually do it. She ran her own marathon during the race, no less than 14 km of running/walking to see her brother with his face drawn and drenched in sweat. I have no idea what she said to me because I was honestly in terrible shape, but as long as she was shouting at me, it kept me going 🤣 At the end, she told me, “You&amp;rsquo;re 50th!” I replied, “Overall?” “No, no, in your age group.” Tough to hear haha. The thing is, in Kona, every little dip in performance costs you. I&amp;rsquo;m not having a bad race, but the competition is so intense that stopping for 5 minutes means losing 10 places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn’t stop me from continuing, and I ran all the way to the airport. I must admit, at that moment, it seemed endless. We were slowly approaching 30 kilometres, and judging by the looks on the other runners’ faces, I wasn’t in the worst shape! I ran a few kilometres with an Englishman, who looked fine but had to stop because of cramps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the Queen K for the last 10 kilometres, and I thought, “Last stretch,” and most of all, I was looking forward to seeing my sister again because I knew she was still at her post! And it exceeded my expectations 🤣 Just before that, I crossed paths with Adrien, who was coming the other way (he started the race almost an hour later), and we had a high five, which gave me a burst of energy! I hear my sister shouting from a distance, encouraging me like crazy, and she tells me I’ve moved up to 40th place. A supporter passing by on a bike (who was French) also cheered me on and complimented my sister for the strength of her encouragements. I kept going and heard my sister still shouting, but getting closer. I thought, “She hasn’t seriously started running to catch up with me, has she?” In the end, she overtook me, straddling the bike seat of the guy 😂 She thought the guy knew me, so she asked him to hop on his bike — it was magical! The video she made during her ride is definitely worth watching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s it, the heat has made her lose her mind,&amp;rdquo; when I had promised my mum I’d keep an eye on my sister 🤣&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finally able to think about this for the last 7 kilometres on the endless Queen K. I also enjoyed the moment; I was, of course, still struggling, but I knew I was finally going to finish this race that had given me so much trouble. For two years I’ve been thinking about this, and now I was going to close the chapter. I slowly approached the finish line, and honestly&amp;hellip; what an atmosphere. Once again, I understood why this race is iconic and what the end of the course represents. In the end, my legs didn’t hurt that much, I was far from my expected race pace, so I decided to lengthen my stride. I wasn’t tired at all, so I finished the last 400 metres at almost 19km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, I didn’t hear anything at the finish line. Audrey was there with the megaphone, but I was in my own bubble. It’s a bit hard to describe those moments; I would actually recommend doing an IRONMAN yourself to fully understand. Looking back, I felt fewer emotions than when I finished the IRONMAN in Klagenfurt last June, where I had fought for first place with everything I had. I was very much in tune with myself back then, and once again, I was able to appreciate the personal work I’ve done over the last few months to fully enjoy the moment with mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;end&#34;&gt;End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s done! Finisher of the IRONMAN World Championships in Hawai’i, in this legendary place. 9 hours and 12 minutes of effort, far from the 8 hours and 45 minutes I had originally planned, finishing in 37th place. I had more ambition, but that will be for another time. And as Rom (yep, him again) would say, even though the performance is poor by my standards, completing 9:12 in Hawai’i on a bad day is still really, really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cross the finish line, a volunteer comes to put a towel around your shoulders, hands you a bottle of water, and walks with you towards the final aid station, and this happens for EVERY triathlete. You really feel privileged. Of course, I ended up with a British volunteer, and we had a good laugh all the way to the tent. As we passed the medical tent, I told her that two years ago, that’s where I had stopped the race, and that today, I had finally made it to the end. I could tell it really moved her, and I almost made myself cry 🥹 Beyond the sport, it’s so amazing to meet people from all around the world at this kind of event — it’s truly enriching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a few bottles of water, I was eating fries by the ocean. I wasn’t too tired, and I was looking forward to meeting my family. I grabbed a nice plate of chips for my girls and set off to find my supporters ♥️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girls were thrilled to see me, but I think it was really the chips that had that effect, haha. Finally, I truly crossed the finish line when I was able to hug my wife, and I mumbled a “we did it” 🥹&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister was there too, and I still don’t understand how she managed to get back so quickly; maybe she stole the man’s bike 🤣&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are, at the end of the story! What an adventure, my friends! To be honest, I was eager to finish the race and move on to the next thing, so we could all rest a little. I thought I could put Hawai&amp;rsquo;i behind me as a great memory and take my foot off the gas. I really believed that, until I crossed the finish line. I thought the fire inside me would calm down — wrong! I was even more motivated at the end! Let’s face it, there will be more race reports to come!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last anecdote before I let you go. When I went to pick up my bike after the race, I noticed that my rear tire was flat 😑. I figured out why I felt like I was dragging towards the end — it must have been deflated. Luckily, it was a slow puncture, but still, that was close! 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could I not finish without saying thank you to everyone who supports me in these adventures — my family, my friends, my coach Rom ( 😗 ), my colleagues (Hello Blue &amp;amp; Green team 💙💚), the unwavering support of HAC Triathlon (thank you Philippe and the team), my club mates, my medical staff with Antoine and Pierre-Antoine, my mental coach Laure Calviac, my partners at Culture Vélo Le Havre (if my bike could talk, it would have some thank yous for you, thank you Laurent and the whole team), Aris (thanks Remi Delahais 🙏), Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration, AB Sports Piscine and Spa (thanks again Alexandre Baril, an amazing team with whom I’ve spent way too much time chatting at the poolside, no wonder swimming takes so long). Thanks also to Julien Debris for his coaching by the pool, Adrien for his kindness and the pleasure of sharing these world championships with me (we’re going back whenever you want!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing the number of people you meet over time; it’s so enriching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how could I not thank my little Lysette 😽 and Jason, who joined us on this journey, my sister Emilie (a thank you will never be enough, but you know what’s in my heart ♥️), and the most beautiful person in my life, who supports me through every moment and helps me grow, without whom this adventure would have never happened. You are the IRONMAN, Audrey, not me ❤️‍🔥&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my daughters ever come across this story, remember that we won’t be going on holidays to Hawai&amp;rsquo;i every year, haha 🤣. Also, you have far more resources than you think, it will take sweat and effort to tap into them, but it will be worth it, no matter the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, this race was a blast. The result, the experience, and the adventure full of obstacles to get there, I found myself again, and I think I unlocked even more things within me! And to top it off, since it&amp;rsquo;s November, I have a mustache for Movember 😎 Doing an IRONMAN with a mustache makes it super special.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after the half IRONMAN World Championships in Finland in Lahti, where I finally got good sensations, it was time to go for the A race of the season, the IRONMAN Florida. Two objectives here: validate the progress made in training by going under the 9-hour mark (now we’re talkingl), and secure a second qualification for the IRONMAN World Championships in Hawaii, scheduled for October 2024.  This will give us time to prepare for the trip or plan another race if I fail to qualify. Still, some ambition going in, because I believe I have progressed well, and I think the hard work my coach Romain had me do is starting to pay off. I did three weeks with 21 hours of training per week, which surprisingly went well (probably because the coach and the athlete did their job well!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was leaving for this destination without my wife and daughters because, you know, between the expenses, the time difference, school holidays, etc., it was a bit complicated. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone, as my sister Emilie would make the trip with me! And because we are great sisters and brothers, we convinced our other sister Chloé to join us. In the end, it would be a family trip, even though our big sister Marie was still missing, but that’s for next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all met at the Paris airport, and I realised my sisters had prepared a surprise. They prepared badges with our faces on them, announcing that they were my support team, and that we were the &amp;ldquo;Team OG.&amp;rdquo; So cool! We couldn&amp;rsquo;t count the number of people who stared at the badges intently throughout the trip (because we wore them everywhere 😂). I even had several people come up to me and ask if I was a professional athlete. The badges were really, really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-a-journey-to-pcb&#34;&gt;What a journey to PCB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first flight left almost 1 hour late, and we had a connection in Atlanta, with 2 hours to reach the other boarding gate. Sounds like a lot. Except when you arrive in the United States and have to go through customs, pick up your bike suitcase, give it back 100 metres away, go through hand luggage control again, and walk through half of the gigantic airport. We missed the connection by 5 minutes 😑&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost 22:00 (local time), and here we are at the airline counter to see what we can do. In the end, we have to wait until the next day to take the first flight at 9:50. At least the airline was quite accommodating; since the delay was their fault, they paid for a night in the hotel of our choice. We also had 2 free meals each at the airport. Considering that the hotel we chose was almost €400 per night, we slept well! Not too stressed, just tired; the three of us were together, so it was okay.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we arrived in Panama City Beach, PCB as they say there, and the first surprise upon leaving the airport was that it was 9 degrees, and with the wind, it felt even colder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be cold anywhere, even in Florida! In the end, the weather warmed up during the week. We arrived at our hotel, a 27-story building on the beach, impressive 😂 It isn&amp;rsquo;t the tourist season, so the building is quite empty, and we have all the facilities just for us: the huge outdoor pool (in case you’re bored with the ocean), the gym, the jacuzzi, the sauna, the cinema (yes, the cinema, with two films a day), and probably other things we didn&amp;rsquo;t see 😂 Well, after these travel adventures, the jacuzzi with a direct view of the sun setting over the ocean was very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the apartment, we even bumped into Arthur Horseau, whom I recognized immediately (he didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize me, despite our super badges!! 😂😂). It&amp;rsquo;s not often that you can meet an athlete of this calibre (he won the Embrunman and finished 6th in the IRONMAN World Championships in Nice this year) in an elevator. Plus, he&amp;rsquo;s super nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final training sessions are done, the bike and body are good. On purpose, I eased off with my coach Romain to arrive fresh for the race, and I made the most of this rest to remove the traces of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-gallerydumb&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-17.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also developed the habit in recent races of adjusting to the race wake-up time almost a week before, so my body gets used to going to bed and waking up early. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to go to bed at 8:30 pm to wake up at 5 am, but on the morning of the race, you&amp;rsquo;re happy when you&amp;rsquo;ve slept well! Check-in done, everything is ready for the race, and I still have a lot of fun with my sisters; it&amp;rsquo;s really cool to share such a special moment with them. Emilie took over my social medias; I think there has never been so much content in such a short time 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;race-day&#34;&gt;Race day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race morning, a calm wake-up at 5 am, we are a 10-minute walk from the start, which is at 6:50 am. I had been stressing a lot (like really) the day before and during the first half of the night, until around 1:30 am when I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;whatever happens tomorrow, you&amp;rsquo;ve done everything you could to prepare properly. If there&amp;rsquo;s an unexpected event, we&amp;rsquo;ll see at that moment. The ONLY thing you can do until the start is to sleep as well as possible.&amp;rdquo; Believe it or not, the stress vanished, and I fell asleep like a baby. The power of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head to the race start, a brief video call with my wife a couple thousands of kilometres away for a final cheer on, it&amp;rsquo;s 14 degrees outside, so it&amp;rsquo;s okay! The temperature will rise to 26 in the afternoon, so great weather overall! I settle my bike, fill my transition bags, everything is in place, and I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely relaxed; it&amp;rsquo;s cool. We head to the start line; we have the American anthem sung a cappella, it&amp;rsquo;s very moving. Americans are really serious about the anthem; we felt like time had stopped, no one moved! Big hugs with my sisters (quite a few tears from me), the organisation puts some music on: Lose Yourself by Eminem. Big adrenaline rush, I tell myself that I&amp;rsquo;m not here for fun. Fair enough, I won&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistake as in Finland; I go to the very front in the starting line. ALL THE WAY TO THE FRONT. The pro men start at 6:40 am, the pro women at 6:45 am, and us at 6:50 am. So, I started at 6:50 am, not 51, at 50 because I finally took responsibility 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swimming consists of 2 loops of 1900m, with an Australian exit on the sand, why not! The first loop goes very well, the water temperature was 23 degrees, so almost too warm with the wetsuit on, and the rising sun is splendid. I feel a bit of current, but there aren&amp;rsquo;t too many waves, so it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to swim. There are thousands of small jellyfish in the water, it&amp;rsquo;s quite funny to pass my hand through them, it reminds me of jelly 😂 They don&amp;rsquo;t sting though, so no risk, but talking to other athletes after the race, I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who found it amusing. A quick run on the sand to start the second loop, with my sisters making more noise than the entire audience combined, impressive 😮&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed the first loop in 28&amp;rsquo;, right on time to redo a 56&amp;rsquo; swim like in Austria, right on track. I start the second loop, but this time with the whole crowd, because the other athletes haven&amp;rsquo;t yet started in the water. A bit tricky to keep the right pace in the middle of packs of swimmers who aren&amp;rsquo;t swimming as fast as me. I lose a bit of time on the second loop, and finished in 58 &amp;lsquo;51&amp;quot;, a bit slower than planned but still well below what I could do before. Quite satisfied overall.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-galleryt1&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-31.jpg&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time to wonder, I rush into the bike transition, still fueled by the cheers of my sisters, and with top-notch energy, I feel good. I put my helmet on, grab my nutrition, my lucky charm bracelet (always the same one made for me by Paola 💙), hop on the bike, and I set off for a 180 km ride of flat terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite windy out there on the road, but it&amp;rsquo;s manageable, better than the previous days. For those who would say &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s easy when it&amp;rsquo;s flat&amp;rsquo;, go outside and ride 180 km on flat terrain. The subtlety is that if you stop pedalling, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a downhill to maintain speed, so you have to pedal all the time, with zero break. And that can really hurt your legs. The same goes for the aero position on the aerobars; except for a few U-turns or stops at the aid stations, you stay in that position, and it&amp;rsquo;s truly exhausting. I rode all alone (literally all alone) until the first aid station at kilometre 50, without moving out from my aerobars, so about 1 hour and 15 minutes in the same position. I had sore trapezius muscles after the race 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s going well; I catch up with other athletes, including some pro women, they are so impressive 😮 Again, some of the athletes don’t follow the drafting rules, but this time I tell  them off myself 😂, especially when they try to hide behind me. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where the referees are once again, so be it. Anyway, we&amp;rsquo;re riding strong, and my legs feel good. I&amp;rsquo;m holding the watts I had planned, with the good position I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on and the disc wheel, it’s going fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenery is quite nice, but you have to enjoy long straight lines. In the end, I don&amp;rsquo;t really notice the time passing; I stick to my hydration/nutrition plan and make sure to wet myself with water as often as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s getting hot compared to the beginning of the bike, so it’s better not to start overheating. I started feeling the urge to pee after 3 hours (important detail!), the first time it has happened to me during a race. Let’s be clear on that, I kept the contents of my bladder INSIDE my bladder. And there you go, that was the standout moment on the bike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up the bike leg, I&amp;rsquo;m quite satisfied with my performance. I had energy throughout the course, was able to push even towards the end of the 180 km, overtaking a few people who didn&amp;rsquo;t seem as fresh as me. Romain had warned me that I might get tired around 130-140 km and would need to push through, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Looking back, I might have been a bit too conservative. I already know he&amp;rsquo;s got some surprises prepared for me in next year&amp;rsquo;s bike training sessions! 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finish the bike leg after a final long straight stretch along the seaside, no time to look at the splendid houses. It took me 4 hours, 36 minutes, and 34 seconds to complete 180 km, averaging 39.2 km/h. I&amp;rsquo;ve made good progress 😂😂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two sisters are at the bike transition to cheer me on! To be honest I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite catch everything they were saying, because of the wind in my ears, being careful not to fall while getting off the bike, and my urge to pee. Too much information to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head straight to the toilet; I thought it would never end. It actually scared Emilie when she saw me heading that way; she thought I had belly issues. But no, I was feeling great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smooth transition, moving quickly but making sure not to forget anything. As all coaches say, &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse speed with haste&amp;rsquo; 😂 (at least that’s what French coaches say!) I grab my sunglasses, a cap, my nutrition, and hydration in my hands and start running. I then place them in the right spots (nutrition in the back pockets of the tri suit, cap on my head, etc. you get the idea), a little trick to save time in transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rush out of transition to start the marathon, hearing Chloé telling me I&amp;rsquo;m 4th in my age group, the two ahead are less than 2 minutes away, and the first is 6 minutes ahead. Let the hunt start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two loops of 21 km for this marathon. Romain and I had discussed a strategy for the marathon. Start the first 10 km coasting, maintain a good pace for the next 20 km to let fatigue set in, and then let it go (as much as possible 😅) in the last 10. The first kilometre feels really good, even at almost 15 km/h, it feels like an easy jog. I manage myself and don&amp;rsquo;t get carried away; I stick to an easy pace, as the coach said. I pass a pro female athlete (a Canadian) who catches up just after, and she asks if I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a sub-3-hour marathon. I say yes. She looks thrilled and asks if she can run with me, why not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my fantastic experience with Read during the World Championships in Finland, here I am embarking on another adventure with Erin Snelgrove. The kilometres pass effortlessly at 4&#39;09&amp;quot;/km (14.5 km/h), in a controlled stride and taking enough water at each aid station. It&amp;rsquo;s 26 degrees with bright sunshine. It&amp;rsquo;s great to run with Erin; she has a beautiful stride and tells me she&amp;rsquo;s currently 7th among the pros and wants to finish 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run into Emilie after 13 or 14 kilometres. She tells me I&amp;rsquo;m in 3rd place (I overtook a competitor without realising it), the 2nd is 1 minute ahead but starting to struggle, and the leader is now only 3 minutes ahead. The chase continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of the first loop, 21 km without a hitch, still with Erin by my side, who tells me that I&amp;rsquo;m a real metronome; it&amp;rsquo;s indeed one of my strengths 😀.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-galleryrun&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-1.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head out for the second loop, and I sense after an aid station that Erin is struggling to pick up the pace, she might have a slight dip in energy. I try to wait for her, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t catch up, and with a bit of sadness, I resume my pace. It&amp;rsquo;s still an individual race, and I still have the first two to catch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run pass Chloé at 23rd kilometre, who tells me I&amp;rsquo;ve passed the 2nd (I don&amp;rsquo;t know when 🤷) and that the leader is now only 2 minutes ahead. Three thoughts cross my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to finish the race easily; I still have energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to chase down the first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll qualify for Hawaii if I keep this up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I speed up a bit (0.5 km/h faster) because it feels effortless. A few kilometres later, I see Emilie, who tells me that I&amp;rsquo;m only a minute and thirty seconds behind the first and that Romain told her he has never run a marathon in less than 3 hours, so I have the advantage. She manages to convey all this information and add encouragementon top of it in record time; she spoke so loudly that you probably heard the echo all the way to France 😂 As I mentioned before, my sisters were an incredible support team! Before the race, we discussed the information I wanted to have during the race and the trigger phrases to motivate me. They executed it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reach the 28th kilometre, and I start to feel that it&amp;rsquo;s getting challenging, even though I&amp;rsquo;m gradually gaining time. I haven&amp;rsquo;t made the last U-turn for the final 10 kilometres yet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have leg pain, but I began to feel a bit of fatigue. Even though we&amp;rsquo;re closer to the end of the race than the beginning, 14 km can feel very, very long if you&amp;rsquo;re struggling. The 4&#39;09&amp;quot;/km pace I&amp;rsquo;ve been maintaining since the start slows down to 4&#39;20&amp;quot;/km for 3 km, and the fatigue persists. I get to the next aid station, which is 50 metres before the U-turn, and I think to myself, &amp;lsquo;Okay, you can walk for 5 seconds, then get back to it.&amp;rsquo; I take a good sip of water, walk easily, counting 5 seconds in my head, then resume and make the U-turn. And I was back in the game. I have 10 km left to enjoy and make the most of the end of this race, which has gone exceptionally well so far, to go after the first place and crush my time on the distance. I get back into the right pace, although honestly&amp;hellip; it hurts 😅.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start a countdown in my head, only 8 kilometers left. 7 kilometers. I pass a guy who looks strong. He has a ton of sponsors on his tri suit. I have a look at his bib, and I see that he&amp;rsquo;s a pro. I&amp;rsquo;ve just overtaken a pro triathlete, even though he started 10 minutes before me. I think he must be having a very bad day, and I also think that I&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress. It&amp;rsquo;s important for my personal pride 😂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 metres later, I hear the first athlete who is going to overtake me during this marathon, and it&amp;rsquo;s not an athlete but a female athlete. It&amp;rsquo;s Erin, who has finally caught up with me. She says something, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what because I&amp;rsquo;m a bit struggling. However, I stay just behind her and try to hang on. Only 4 kilometres left. I see a tall building not so far away and set myself a goal to get back next to Erin (not behind her) starting from that building. We reach the building, and here we are, side by side again for the final 3 kilometres. There&amp;rsquo;s much more atmosphere in this part of the race, and even though my legs are starting to send me distress signals, there&amp;rsquo;s no way I&amp;rsquo;m slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 kilometre to go, my hamstrings are on the brink of cramping. I&amp;rsquo;m fully focused not to make a misstep; otherwise, I’m probably going to have a hard time getting back up. Erin picks up the pace even more, breaching by a few metres. I tell her to go on and keep going. Less than a hundred metres to go, I see Chloé one last time, who tells me the leader is 20 seconds ahead. A little shot of adrenaline, and I pick up the pace too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last right turn to head towards the end. I see the finish line, and it feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve launched into a crazy sprint. In my head, it’s like I’m running at least at 20 km/h. In reality, it&amp;rsquo;s 16 km/h 😂 but not too bad for the end of an IRONMAN marathon. I finished it in 2 hours and 58 minutes. Here’s the sub 3h marathon! No idea what happens next; I&amp;rsquo;m shattered. A volunteer talks to me and walks with me to the finish tent. I must have told her my life, but I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember what. I just recall being really happy with my race, relieved to have finished, and I gave her the bracelet we received as a gift to thank her for participating in organising the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meet Erin just after that; she tells me she finally finished 4th in the race, beyond her expectations! And she says it was so cool to have run together. I can’t agree more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished 2nd in 8h42’04”, just 50 seconds behind Victor, not 20 seconds. He was indeed 20 seconds ahead of me when Chloé saw him (because she actually started a timer when she saw him pass by), but he must have started 30 seconds behind me at the beginning! It just goes to show that in the end, it&amp;rsquo;s the little details that matter. Those 50 seconds are probably about the time I spent in the toilets during the transition after the bike 😑.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to him the next day, he&amp;rsquo;ll tell me he was really scared because his wife told him I was catching up to him. It was close! I jokingly told him we would meet again in Hawaii for a rematch. We both laughed, but we also know we weren&amp;rsquo;t joking at all, and we&amp;rsquo;ll do our best to beat the other ah ah ah 😂. We still are competitors even if we respect each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I leave the post-race tent and meet my sisters, and we can all let our emotions out; there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bunch to release 😂. I need to sit for a bit at a table because I don&amp;rsquo;t feel great, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get cold, and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit nauseous, but it goes away in a few minutes. I&amp;rsquo;ve never experienced this after a race, but it makes me realise that I truly gave it all in the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I video call Audrey; I can finally tell her that we did it, and we&amp;rsquo;re going back to Hawaii 😀 (I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break in writing the report to grab some tissues ahahah). While I was on the phone, my sisters went to get ice cream to recharge. So many emotions during this race!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I&amp;rsquo;ve shared quite a bit about my life! But there were some adventures to tell. I didn&amp;rsquo;t come to Florida for fun! Now, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the 2024 season, with Hawaii as the highlight, and this time the race report will be a good one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this far. The 2023 season ended on a positive note, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of hope and expectations for the next one 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say, other than a massive thank you to all the people who support me in my adventures—my beloved daughters, my family, my friends, my colleagues (current or former), my coach Romain Guillaume, my partners (Tacher Acogex, Culture Vélo Le Havre, Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration), my physio Antoine, my osteopath Pierre-Antoine, my club the HAC Triathlon, my beloved SRE team 💚💙 (they are direct witnesses of how hard Thursday training days can be 😂), my company Doctolib, and my village of Mannevillette (it was so funny when the speaker mentioned my name and village to call me on the podium).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special mention to my two sisters, my crew for this race, who must have been as tired as me after the race given how much energy they spent. We had a lovely week together on another continent, and we have so many new memories. Mum, I took good care of my sisters, and they took good care of me 😂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey, even 7,000 km away, you were with me 💙💙💙.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fueling and hydration, all with Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration (PF&amp;amp;H) products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before swim:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T1:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bottles (1L each) with 120g of PF&amp;amp;H mix (120g carbs/2000mg sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bottle (800 mL) with 1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g &amp;amp; 1 packet of PF&amp;amp;H 1000 (90g carbs/1000mg sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~3 water bottles (500mL each)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 PF&amp;amp;H gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T2:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 PF&amp;amp;H gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 soft flask (500mL) with 1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 30g and 1 packet of PF&amp;amp;H 1000 (30g carbs et 1000mg sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 electrolyte capsules (250mg sodium each)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 glass of water (~100 mL) per aid station (20 in total)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that gives around 94,18g carbs, 813mg of sodium and 790mL of water per hour for this race. Quite close to what I did during the race in Finlande, but for twice as long. More sodium and water, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a surprise given the fact that it was hotter (and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel Audrey shaking me to wake me up; I slowly emerge from sleep as she whispers, &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s 5:30, the alarm didn&amp;rsquo;t ring!&amp;rsquo;. The alarm was supposed to ring an hour ago, and 5:30 was the time we would leave to go to the Half IRONMAN World Championships that morning. With an hour-long drive and the bike park closing at 7:30, we were cutting it close. Another race off to a great start! 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened since the big failure in Hawaii last October, and needless to say, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to leave it like that when I returned. Audrey had warned me, “If you stop here, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret it for the rest of your life.” And since I always listen to my wife (even if I don&amp;rsquo;t always admit it), we decided on the next steps. Two things came out of it:
Triathlon takes time, and finding the right balance with family and work life is crucial. A 6-hour bike ride on Sunday morning is not exactly a gift, both for the one staying home with the kids and the one heading out to ride. So, if we were going all in on training, we might as well find a way to do it with the least impact. That&amp;rsquo;s where I asked my company (Doctolib) to switch to part time (80%) (another brilliant idea from my wife). And I’d like to thank them (thanks Florian, Stan, Jad, and Raphaël for your trust). Thursdays will now be dedicated to training, and given the sessions I was about to endure, it was a good idea.
Beyond a certain level of performance, there&amp;rsquo;s a quest to maximise training for efficiency. Since training volume is a significant factor in progress, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go wrong with the method. That&amp;rsquo;s why I sought the help of a coach, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Romain Guillaume, a pro triathlete, comes into play. He was highly recommended by Hind, a triathlete I had met in 2019 for the IRONMAN in Finland (hi Hind!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since last November 2022, I got back to work with a lot of dedication and plenty of new advice and methods from Romain. Not a revolution in itself since the principle remains the same. Consistency, progressiveness, and the right mix of volume and intensity at the right times. Not having to decide everything relieves a lot of stress, especially since it can be challenging to be objective when you are coaching yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romain reassured me and demystified a lot about how to train, especially about the moments when you should stop training. He also brought his pro experience and sessions that I would NEVER have dared to do, because I would have thought it was suicidal (both in terms of injury risks and fatigue). And in the end, it worked 😂, even when he schedules a 7-hour training session on a Thursday. Not a scratch. Well, let me rephrase that, I was completely shattered after those sessions, but it would put the rest of the training at risk. Even when the session is titled &amp;lsquo;Brick Run - it&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt!!!!!!!&amp;rsquo; In the end, the coach knows better than we do what we are capable of. &amp;lsquo;Trust the coach, trust the process.&amp;rsquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear, overall everything went well, but there are still sessions where you’d feel lousy, and everything would be tough even though it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be an easy session. There are moments when you&amp;rsquo;d rather stay warm at home because you&amp;rsquo;re tired and it&amp;rsquo;s raining outside (it never rains in Normandy ah ah…). And the next day, you’d feel like a war machine during the toughest session of the week. Not easy to understand how our bodies work sometimes 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, having a coach like Romain is a great experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-back-on-2023&#34;&gt;Step back on 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2023, I had four major events:
Vendôme (France) triathlon at the end of May (half IRONMAN distance)
IRONMAN Klagenfurt, Austria, at the end of June (to see where I’m at in my training and try and beat my PB)
Half IRONMAN World Championships in Lahti, Finland, at the end of August (that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about in this report for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t following), thanks to my qualification in Weymouth, England, in September 2022 (where I won in my category, and also for which I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to write a race report!)
IRONMAN Florida, USA, at the beginning of November&amp;hellip; to once again qualify for Hawaii in 2024.
A great program!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the season with cross-country races went quite well, even though I still had heel pain (a result of my surgery a year earlier! Tendons rehabilitation takes a long time), training was going well, and I began to regain confidence.
A second-place finish in the Vendôme L triathlon at the end of May confirmed that my form had returned, even though I struggled and was quite disappointed with my run. Some might say, &amp;lsquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s still good to finish on the podium despite not having a good race.&amp;rsquo; Yes, but it&amp;rsquo;s far from satisfying. I made some mistakes that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have, and I really wanted to perform well to get back on track after Hawaii. In short, the race left me with a sense of unfinished business and a slight heel pain, just when I thought I could put that behind me. I felt my heel tingling several times during the run, especially in the trail sections where the ground would be unstable.
The pain was there again when I resumed training, and my physiotherapist (my dear Antoine) confirmed that there was a slight inflammation, nothing very serious but that I would need to be patient. However, the IRONMAN in Austria was just a month away. I did my best during this time to deal with the inflammation; it didn&amp;rsquo;t improve, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t get worse either. I was so accustomed to this pain that it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Austria, I had resigned myself to the situation – we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes during the race! It&amp;rsquo;s a shame because this race also deserves its race report, but honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do everything, and I can&amp;rsquo;t let myself write something rubbish. Writing a report takes me 5+ hours!. Anyway, aside from the breathtaking landscapes of Austria, I had the best swim of my life in 56 minutes, aiming for less than an hour, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. Finally, that feeling of being more like a fish in the water than a stone. I had done a few sessions with Valéry (Toupin) before this race, and in my head, I kept telling myself, &amp;lsquo;be a dolphin like Valéry.&amp;rsquo; From the inside, it seemed to work; from the outside, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I was still happy with myself! Smooth transition to the bike and a fantastic 180km course, where I clearly had a great time. Only the last hour was starting to get a bit tough, but I also had the best bike leg of my life in 4 hours and 58 minutes, averaging 36 km/h, cool! Another smooth transition to the run, surprisingly zero heel pain, I was super happy. I covered the first 10 kilometres in 42 minutes, perfect for the goal of under 3 hours on the marathon and under 9 hours in total. I felt really good until my heel pain came back. I gritted my teeth, then started to slow down, then limped more and more. That&amp;rsquo;s when I told myself two things:
I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the first loop (the race consisted of 2 loops of 21km) because Audrey is waiting for me there, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want her to worry.
I&amp;rsquo;ll stop the race here. I know I can finish it, but if it&amp;rsquo;s going to damage my heel, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a major race (except for chasing a time), and the rest of the race went very well.
So, I stopped at kilometre 21, but without regret and with a clear conscience. Audrey was much more disappointed than I was! I just remember telling her, &amp;lsquo;My heel hurts; there&amp;rsquo;s no point in continuing. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit frustrating. Plus I&amp;rsquo;m not even tired.&amp;rsquo; And it was true; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly tired, not even sore legs. A good sign, the preparation was really good. But we&amp;rsquo;re not here to talk about Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sponsors&#34;&gt;Sponsors!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, THREE great pieces of news came in – I found THREE sponsors to support me! 🎉
This was an initiative I had started before Hawai’i (a bit hastily, I must say), and my club and the city of Le Havre had stepped up to give me a hand! This time, I once again used my portfolio to approach businesses. It&amp;rsquo;s quite uncomfortable and strange (for me) to do this. Sport is a passion, and I don&amp;rsquo;t do it to make money. But it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to involve local companies or simply get people involved in a sporting adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Tacher Acogex, an accounting firm, volunteered to support me in my sporting project. I can never thank Laura enough for believing in me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration, a British sports nutrition company that offered its support. Given the amount of food we ingest for triathlon training, this assistance is very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m also fortunate to be able to rely on Culture Vélo Le Havre to support me and ensure performance by helping me finance the acquisition of a disc wheel and the maintenance of my equipment. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge plus for my practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for your support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-we-are-finland&#34;&gt;Here we are Finland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to our story. Off we went to Finland (our two daughters, Audrey, and I), with our dear friends Mélanie and Vincent and their two children. Well, I had to take the plane the day before because my bike had been rejected a week before due to some baggage quota issue. I&amp;rsquo;ll spare you the panic, the flight change with additional costs, and the additional expenses (train, hotel night, etc.). Even though it&amp;rsquo;s not the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve had these kinds of hiccups, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of energy and stress. Everyone arrived safe in the end, and here we were again on the roads of Finland amid forests and lakes, after a last-minute stress because we struggled to put the bike suitcase into the car (that was tough, right Vincent?). Honestly, travelling with a bike is &amp;ldquo;a bit&amp;rdquo; of a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t give you a detailed story of our vacation, but between the lakeside house with no neighbours within earshot, grasshopper fishing, boat rides, and the bearskin on the living room wall, it was a true joy to be there. The children loved it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ironkids&#34;&gt;IRONKIDS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids also had their first race for IRONKIDS, except for Livia, who had already done her first race in Hawai’i (not a bad start for her sports career). Another moment full of emotions; Pénélope, at the tender age of 1 and a half, covered the entire 300 metres in one go (she also tried to grab another child&amp;rsquo;s cookie on the side). Esteban took off so quickly he almost left us behind, and Paola gave us an epic 200-metre sprint finish. SO COOL! All of this took place in a massive athletics stadium right next to the ski jump ramps, very, very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;race-day&#34;&gt;Race day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recall the beginning of the story, we woke up late, but we still made it on time and before the bike park closed. In the end, we put unnecessary pressure on ourselves, ah ah&amp;hellip; I was surprisingly calm this morning, Audrey wasn’t, whereas usually, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s good to switch roles because pre-race stress is really not my favourite part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the race venue without any issues; I went to the bike park. Everything was okay, the bike was ready (with my magnificent disc wheel thanks to Culture Vélo Le Havre!). I placed my bottles on it, shoes were clipped onto the pedals and secured with elastics (to be able to jump on the bike at the transition exit), and the tires were well-inflated. We just had to head to the start area about 1 km away. The pros had already started and exited the water; I would have liked to see them, but I was in the race too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short 5-minute jog, I put on the wetsuit, swim for 5 minutes (a good habit I&amp;rsquo;ve developed to avoid having burning shoulders at the start of the race, very unpleasant), even though I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of getting wet before cracking on. It&amp;rsquo;s 8:20, and my start is in 10 minutes. So, I think it would be a good idea to get there. I finish getting ready, everyone wishes me good luck, I shed a small tear (as usual), it&amp;rsquo;s so cool to have my family and friends by my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head to the starting area; each age group starts separately every 15 minutes, with a rolling start (meaning in groups of 7 people). Surprisingly, I&amp;rsquo;m alone even though the start is in 5 minutes. I still find it strange that no one is there 5 minutes before the start, and then I realise that I must actually be the ONLY ONE NOT YET in the starting area. A little moment of stress and a sprint later, I join the other 500 athletes in my category, who were all already ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I deserve a small (according to my wife, a big) slap on the head. I’m here taking my time without panicking and almost missing the start. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;ve never had issues before. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m ready, I try to get as close to the front as possible but quickly get stuck, and I blame myself because I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be swimming with triathletes slower than me in the water, and that&amp;rsquo;s not good. It means I&amp;rsquo;ll spend my time zigzagging and losing time. Another mistake not to repeat. We start from a pontoon that is a metre above the water; I knew that in advance, so I practised diving to get used to it and not lose my goggles along the way. I&amp;rsquo;m calm and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s my turn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few metres to run before diving, where everyone joyfully pushes each other (we&amp;rsquo;re all still boys who like to play around in the end, ah ah ah), and I &amp;ldquo;dive.&amp;rdquo; The dive itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad (I didn&amp;rsquo;t belly flop), but the two guys next to me did a pretty rubbish jump, pushing me at the same time, so I dove quite crooked. And I lost my goggles in the process&amp;hellip; I come out with the goggles askew, luckily no one sees it, I put them back on, and I paddle my arms to find my place. Sorry to those who got bumped, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the game. I took a few hits too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swimming goes well, even though, as expected, I spend my time overtaking and zigzagging to pass people. The water is less cold than expected (18 degrees), probably because of the adrenaline running through my veins. I have to stop several times completely because large packs have formed. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit chaotic. Overall, I swam ok, and much better than in previous years, in 28&#39;55&amp;quot;. I know I could have swum faster, but I would have had to stop daydreaming at the start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many spectators and a lively atmosphere during the transition, with all my supporters on the side! The bike park is quite large, so there is quite a bit of distance to cover to retrieve the bag, change, take my lucky bracelet (crafted by Paola 💙), grab the bike, and head out on the course. Five minutes later, I pass the mounting line and cautiously get on my bike; my hands are a bit cold, but other than that, it’s all good.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the race is rolling, like the rest, with no major difficulties except for a few climbs that don’t last more than 5-10 minutes, so it was fast riding all the way! The roads are straight and well-maintained, very enjoyable. Quite a few people were already on the bike; we (the 30-34 age group) started after many other categories. After a few kilometres, an uninvited guest (well-known in Normandy) arrived for the party. Rain. Not just raindrops. POURING RAIN. One minute later, I was soaked, and the rain didn&amp;rsquo;t stop until the end of the day. I felt like I was at the Battle of Helm&amp;rsquo;s Deep in The Lord of the Rings. You really think about strange things during a race. I also thought about my speech for the following week, as I was becoming the godfather of my friends&amp;rsquo; daughter 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the pouring rain, with my arms getting increasingly numb, and being careful not to fall. Not much to say during the bike since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything with the rain, except for the guys drafting unashamedly even though it&amp;rsquo;s prohibited, while the referees would pass by without saying anything. I just can’t get it. These guys are at the half IRONMAN World Championships, and they cheat (as soon as you don&amp;rsquo;t respect the rules, it&amp;rsquo;s cheating, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit disappointed in the athletes&amp;rsquo; attitude, but maybe I expect too much. I would have liked the referees from the IRONMAN Austria to be there; they wouldn’t forgive anything. I remember being in a group of 7, making sure to respect the drafting distance (i.e., staying far enough from the bike in front of me to avoid being in the drafting zone and risking a 5-minute penalty), but I was the only one. The referees passed once on a motorcycle, stopped at the next roundabout, and came back putting a penalty card on everyone except me. Ah ah ah. Justice 😂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the hardest part is drinking because my hands are so frozen that I can’t squeeze my water bottle. And my whole nutrition is in the bottle, so not drinking is not an option! I reach the end of the course and hear the sweet sound of my wife&amp;rsquo;s megaphone, what a pleasure! I start to feel some leg pain towards the end, but nothing serious, so far, everything is going smoothly. 2 hours 15 minutes and 50 seconds to cover the 90km, averaging 39.7 km/h, I&amp;rsquo;ve never ridden so fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition zone is a huge (like really huge!) sports hall, and it takes me more than 4 minutes to transition to running. The size of the sports facilities in the city of Lahti is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides frozen fingers, the rest of my body is fine, and I set off happily for a half marathon, determined to enjoy myself and break the curse of my heel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running course is quite demanding, with some hills and very long climbs. Over 200m of positive elevation gain is a lot for a half marathon, especially in triathlon. So, it&amp;rsquo;s not a flat race, and there&amp;rsquo;s no hope of achieving a fantastic time. Two laps of 10.5km each, with a passage on the stadium where we had the IRONKIDS. The race alternates between sections in the woods and passes through lakeside homes; a very nice run!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lap goes smoothly, with great sensations. I pass many people and run at over 16km/h; I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased. I remember passing the 15km sign (for the second lap) and thinking, &amp;lsquo;when you pass this on the second lap, nothing can stop you, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to fully enjoy.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run into all my supporters, who, despite the rain, are there to cheer me on.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start the second lap, and I feel an athlete starting to catch up with me. It&amp;rsquo;s the first person who&amp;rsquo;s going to overtake me, so I tell myself it&amp;rsquo;s time to hang on and see what I have left in my legs. The person comes next to me, and I set my pace the same, which, in the end, is not much higher than mine. We didn&amp;rsquo;t look at each other, but I felt an unspoken agreement and an immediate synchronisation. Some may find it strange, but the connection was there. And the show began! We set a very good pace and start passing a ton of athletes. I felt like a steamroller, and the kilometres passed effortlessly. It was truly exciting. That&amp;rsquo;s how I met Read (Ziegler). Although our strides were very different, with his being very powerful, and mine being quite elastic (a true deer), we challenged each other on the uphills and downhills. He has an impressive physique, and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m running next to Terminator 😂.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I reached the 15th kilometre, I realised that it was even easier than I thought to make the most of the present moment. Sometimes, we experience quite unique adventures; I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of Finland with my loved ones, participating in the Half IRONMAN World Championships. It&amp;rsquo;s pouring rain, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a challenging year physically and mentally, but I&amp;rsquo;ve just found an American pal to run the end of the half marathon with, and I feel great. What a thrill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reach the 19th kilometre, and the race is ending soon. I decide to start a conversation with Read. We&amp;rsquo;ve been running almost 10km side by side without exchanging a word, even though we started running together. He tells me it&amp;rsquo;s his first lap since he&amp;rsquo;s in the 25-29 age category, and they started after us. I tell him I’m sad it’s the end of the race, and that I would have liked to do a third lap, even though, well, even if I feel good, I’m getting tired. Finally, he tells me that he will miss me 🤗 Awesome run together. There&amp;rsquo;s 1km left, I tell Read that I&amp;rsquo;m going to let it all out to finish the race, and I wish him to have fun and enjoy the second lap, to which he replies with a very American &amp;ldquo;Yes, Sir,&amp;rdquo;, love it 😂. I rush past my supporters, finishing the race in a somewhat euphoric state, so relieved to finally have a good race without pain. I have a vague memory of &amp;ldquo;expressing my joy&amp;rdquo; (read shouting as hard as I can) before the finish line, completing the half marathon in 1h19&#39;12&amp;quot; and the entire race in 4h12&#39;18&amp;quot;. My best time for this distance, despite the quite challenging course and the rain worthy of a Norman autumn. Training and efforts have paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read will finish the race in 4h05&#39;42&amp;quot;, what an athlete! I&amp;rsquo;m really happy to have shared this moment with him. I’m used to running alone, so it was very cool to run with someone, especially someone as strong as him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up being 47th/518 in my age group (30-34 years old) in a very strong field (less than 30 seconds for the 4 athletes in front of me), and 203rd/3935 overall (including the pros). Cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this far; it&amp;rsquo;s so much easier to write reports about &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; races! What can I say except a huge thank you to all the people who support me in my adventures—my wonderful daughters who endured the rain during the race, my family, friends, colleagues (current or former), my coach Romain Guillaume, my partners (Tacher Acogex, Culture Vélo Le Havre, Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration), my physio Antoine, my osteopath Pierre-Antoine, my triathlon club HAC, my beloved SRE team 💚💙 (they are direct witnesses of how hard Thursday training days can be 😂), my company Doctolib, and my village of Mannevillette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, the person who is always by my side, without whom I would be lost 🩵 (even if we almost missed the race because of the alarm!). I often say it, but beyond the race and training, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole organisation and logistics to think about to make everything work, to get to the race, and, above all, not jeopardise our relationship. Audrey and I really are a team, and most of the actions we put in place come from her. She&amp;rsquo;s the brains of the group, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest 😂 I&amp;rsquo;m the legs, and I execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, life is like elevators; there are ups and downs. When there are downs, you have to grit your teeth and double your efforts while waiting to climb back up. When there are ups like today, you have to enjoy the moment to the fullest before the next down 😂.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fueling and hydration, all with Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration (PF&amp;amp;H) products:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before swim:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T1:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bottles (1L each) with 60g of PF&amp;amp;H mix (60g of carbs/1000mg of sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transition T2:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 soft flask (500mL) with PF&amp;amp;H electrolytes (1000mg sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that gives around 109,7g carbs, 731mg of sodium and 605mL of water per hour for this race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to go, I&amp;rsquo;ll let you enjoy the view we had from our house in Finland:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where shall I start? 🤔 19th of July 2020, I finished my registration for  IRONMAN Finland in August 2021, with in mind the goal of being much stronger than before, and also to finally finish a full IRONMAN. The one I did in Nice in 2019 was shortened due to the heat wave. I also had a secret goal of qualifying for the IRONMAN world championship in Hawaï, for which I had to be in the top 3 of my age group (30-34 years old). This was a bold goal, as I ranked 27th at Nice, a long  away from the podium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t come up with this objective randomly. I knew I had a chance given what I thought I should be able to do with a decent training plan, and the statistics I analysed for other athletes who qualified the previous years. So  I thought, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it turned out… It was a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, we ARE going to Hawaiï! I managed to finish second in my age group and 13th overall, way beyond my expectations. I had five sub goals when I arrived at the race:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To swim less than an hour on the 3.8km (~2.3 miles) swim - I failed ❌&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To cycle less than 5 hours on the 180km (~111 miles) bike race - Also failedl ❌&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To run less than 3 hours  during the marathon (26 miles) - Failed again❌&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To qualify for Hawaiï - I succeeded ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do an awesome race and be proud of myself - I succeeded ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two out of five, not that good, the two most important ones are successes though. I almost managed to nail the other three too, so quite awesome overall! Here are some details about the race:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finish time&lt;/strong&gt; 9h16’21”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd in my age group (30-34 years old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9th man overall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13th overall (yeah the pro females are faster than me, they are SO impressive!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swim 3.8km&lt;/strong&gt; - 1h02’02”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1’38”/100m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;34 strokes/min on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47th overall (not so good)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition T1&lt;/strong&gt; - 2’54”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bike 180km 1200m D+&lt;/strong&gt; - 5h04’10”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;35.51 km/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200 Watts on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;211 Watts normalized power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;220 TSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;59th overall (this is bad…)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition T2&lt;/strong&gt; - 2’14”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run 42km 400m D+&lt;/strong&gt; - 3h05’04”
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4’24”/km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;309 Watts on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;159 RSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd overall (this is good!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still some work to do to improve swimming and biking, running is good enough. Let’s see what happened during the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-plan-and-going-to-finland&#34;&gt;Training plan and going to Finland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in fact the most crucial part to perform correctly during the IRONMAN. One year of training and planning, trying to validate steps and improvements, all of this during several lockdowns. I definitely wanted to reach the next level on the bike and the swim, as I was pretty fed up of being largely beaten by other athletes. I knew my running was enough though, but it wouldn’t be enough to be on the podium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my swim time during IRONMAN Nice was 1h01’, going for a sub 1 hour was in my reach. But, that assumption was in an ideal world without the Covid pandemic, that led to shutting down the swimming pools in October&amp;hellip;. I didn’t even have the time to re-start swimming seriously. However, I was super determined to do a good preparation, and even more determined to make it to the starting line with no regret and no excuse. It’d be too easy to say “I could have done better without the Covid”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went to my parents to pick up an inflatable swimming pool, just deep enough to swim statically in it, and I set it up in my garden. It was just a matter of time before I had fixed a rope on the pole outside the swimming pool, tied that rope to an old inner tube (to get some sort of elasticity), then tied that tube to a belt around my waist, and here I was swimming ! It’s boring, it feels different , but at least I could train. With my wetsuit on obviously. I still wonder what my neighbors thought when passing by next to the house 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick reminder on Norman weather in autumn and winter, it’s not that warm. The water in the pool slowly cooled down from 13 degrees to less than 5 starting in December. It was ok when it was around 10 to 13, but I had to put on gloves, neoprene socks, and an additional neoprene hooded vest when the water was between 5 and 10. And I swam for 15 to 20 minutes before I thought I would freeze to death! It was almost impossible to swim more than 15 minutes below 5 degrees. I don’t have enough fat on my belly 😁&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body loses its heat really rapidly when you are in cold water, and once it starts cooling down, all your blood goes to your vital organs, so no blood in your hands, feet, etc. Then it starts to really hurt. I am not usually the soft kind, I can handle pain, but it was really very painful. The worst being when you finally take a shower and the blood goes back to your hands. I am not ashamed to say that I actually screamed a couple times because of the pain 😅 such a pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reap what you sow, so I would go back three times a week, not knowing if my swimming  would improve, but at least I wouldn’t get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many months after, the swimming pools eventually opened again, it took a couple months to go back to my previous level. Since I was determined to have the best chance of succeeding, I thought it would be interesting to swim in open water too, as the swim race would be in a lake. But we don’t have lakes in Normandy, we have the sea, but it’s definitely not the same. So… I had a look on Google Maps, spotted two big ponds (around 200 meters long) next to the Château du Bec (a big medieval castle you can rent for weddings), and called the owner. I explained my plan to her and everything. She  was really enthusiastic and told me to come and give it a go! Here I was, once or twice a week, walking down the castle enclosure with my wetsuit in my backpack to go for a swim in the lake. An amazing  experience, I could get used to swimming with the wetsuit, swim in a straight line, not freak out when a fish came next to me or when I touched a stick floating in the water 😅 What a blast for a medieval fan like me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the bike, I had already made some improvements since the half IRONMAN world championships in Nice in 2019. The idea was to keep improving and also work a lot on the aero position, as I now have a real triathlon bike. Maintaining a good position is a real challenge when you have to keep it for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from a couple of outside rides, I stayed indoors on the trainer, i.e. in my garage in front of a screen. Some workouts would be super intense but would last an hour, some would be easy but really long (4 to 5 hours). I spent quite a lot of Saturday mornings watching films, listening to some podcasts or music, reading books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of the trainer is that your legs always have to push the pedals, so there’s no coasting during a workout (brief periods where you don’t pedal at all). That makes the workout much more time effective. Plus you don’t have to worry about  the weather or the cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I went up to around 15 hours of training per week, which is quite a lot when you also want to spend  time with your family and go to work! There’s always a moral contract your family and you have to agree on, otherwise you’re going to have some issues. All my workouts were in the calendar, including the time at which I would do them and how long they would last. I would share my feelings about my training, and make the necessary adjustments if needed, because life is not straightforward ! I also didn’t want triathlon to interfere with my life too much. My daughter doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about my training, she won’t ask if I’m tired, she just wants me to play and run after her 😁 that’s what it really takes to be an ironman !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here we are arriving in Finland, fully vaccinated, fully prepared for the race. Audrey and Livia are with me, we get to the house in the evening on Tuesday, the race is on Saturday. The wooden house is right next to a big lake in the middle of the forest, we definitely are in Finland! Three days to go to the athlete registration, do a quick bike ride on the roads we are going to race on, swim in the lake, check the legs can still run fast and drop the transition bags and the bike on Friday. We also made the most of that time to have some rest, it’s been a while since our last holiday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could feel the stress mounting as the race day got closer. One evening, Audrey gave me a big envelope in which I discovered a TON of letters, drawings, cards, and cheerful messages from my family and friends. My sisters even made a special song just for me ! I will come back to it later on but I was really (REALLY) touched by all that love and I must say I cried a lot 😆&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race day, finally, legs are burning from excitement, stomach filled up with breakfast. Audrey didn’t sleep well, but funnily enough I did 😆 Our daughter woke up on her own 15 minutes before departure, she’s a perfect little girly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We jump in the car and go to the transition zone only five minutes away for home, super easy logistics for this IRONMAN! Last bike check up, I put all my drinks and food in the bags and on the bike, last mental visualisation of the transition to perform, and we walk to the start line. Weather is amazing, a clear blue sky with 17 degrees, it’s going to be a fine day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just enough time to warm up a bit, put my wetsuit on, and give a last kiss to my daughter and wife. So much effort and training to be here, so many people behind me to support me, it’s finally happening. I turn to Audrey and say “I’m going to cry so hard if don’t focus” 😆 (I’m still trying to focus when writing the report!). I went to the starting line, started doing fist bumps to cheer on other athletes, this is going to be so awesome! In position, 3, 2, 1… BIP! All out now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped in the lake (turns out I just walked in the water when I had a look at Audrey&amp;rsquo;s video 😂, not so epic) and started swimming. Water was perfect (20 degrees), compared to the swimming pool in the garden in December, it’s heaven. It almost has a sweet taste, so much better than sea water. I scream in the water to let out some emotion, I am so happy to be racing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can seem a bit weird, but we are so filled up with adrenaline, hormones, and emotions that it has to come out one way or another. My arms felt good. Now I just had to wait for 3.8 km… It’s quite a long way when you swim, and since you can’t hear anything (your head is mostly below the surface), nor can you see (or really quickly when you take a breath), it tends to be a bit boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still made the most of it though, the lake and the landscape was beautiful, the sun was just above the treetops, I had almost no one around me so it was easy to relax and swim like during training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the water in 1h02’, that’s 2 minutes behind schedule but I felt really fresh, as if I hadn’t swum at all, which is good because there was still 8 to 9 hours of race ahead. I ran to my bike, put on my helmet, bib, and socks and rushed through the exit, less than 3 minutes, very good. My bike shoes were already clipped on the pedals to save some time, I just had to slip my feet in and start pushing the pedals for the next 180 km!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding your bike is fun, you can go fast, you see a lot of different landscapes, but most of the time it ends  with a sore bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick ride on the same road a couple days before, I was pretty confident I could ride the 180 km in less than 5h. It was not a technical road, it was long straight lines between the trees. So much different than in Nice where you had to really concentrate! It was never flat though. No big climbs or descents, but the real challenge was to handle the always changing road where you could hardly maintain a regular pace for more than a few minutes. On top of the undulating road, the trees and the lakes next to the road would create strange air masses, making it hard to understand why you would suddenly ride at 30 km/h in a descent and speed up to 45km/h in the next climb with a strong headwind. That was quite disturbing, so I focused on my wattage to stay in the power zones I knew I could hold for four or five hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was split into two 85 km loops, and connected to a 5 km (3.1 mile) segment towards the bike park. The weather was really nice, it was warm and sunny, and despite the strong wind on some portions, I enjoyed riding my bike! But even though I had made some significant improvements on the bike, I was still unable to compete properly with the other guys, which was a bit frustrating… But that was not enough to disturb me or make me diverge from my plan. An IRONMAN is first a race against yourself, trying to overdo it or following someone you don’t know nearly always ends up in failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stick to the plan, and trust yourself. Speaking of plans, I also strictly followed my nutrition and hydration plans, with custom date bars and honey gels. When we think about sport, we most of the time think about the workouts. When it comes to endurance sports, and especially long races like an IRONMAN, nutrition and hydration are key! You simply cannot hold your pace for multiple hours without fuelling your body, that’s humanly impossible. And the more quality food you ingest, the better. You are not going to put standard gas in a race car right? Same goes for your body. It’s also better to eat the same things you are used to eating during training, because your gut becomes highly efficient to digest that food, the easier the better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fine bike leg in the end, no mechanical issues, no sliding, nothing but strong riding through the middle Finland landscapes. It rained heavily  for the last 20 minutes, the weather started to deteriorate unfortunately…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually reached the bike park after 5h04’, a bit behind schedule again, but I had to hold back during the last 40 km as my left thigh started cramping during climbs. And boy you are going to need that leg on the 42 km run race! The only thing I had in mind was to show the other athletes that even though they beat me on the bike, I would crush them on the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped off my bike and ran to my rack position, I emptied my shoes carefully, in which I put my nutrition for the run, that’s a pro tip to avoid forgetting something 😁 I then rushed through the bike park and started leaping like a stag. My legs felt a bit achy but that was the normal state after 5 hours of bike, I knew that wouldn’t prevent me from running fast. First kilometer done in 4’06” (almost 15 km/h), it didn’t feel like I was running, it felt so easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do a sub 3h marathon, so that meant staying at a 4’16”/km pace or lower. The course was quite technical, a lot of little climbs and descents on gravel roads or trails, not that easy! Maintaining a steady pace was again not possible, and there were almost zero entirely flat sections. But nevermind, legs are good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four 10km loops for this course. One of the good things about being at the front of the race is that you’re on your own on the first laps, so you have all the supporters on the side of the road just for you! Especially the two best supporters of the world, my wife and daughter 😁 Even when they were out of sight, I could hear Audrey’s megaphone. I would then run proudly past them, waving and smiling at them. Hard not to cry and keep your composure to be honest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the kind of athlete who remains concentrated and focused on the road in front of him, I like to enjoy the encouragement and thank the volunteers (even if it’s just a smile when you are gasping for air). It gives so much energy to share this moment, and not to mention that smiling makes the effort easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 25 km, pace was still steady and I had already overtaken most of those who had beaten me on the bike. I told you the race was not finished! Third lap ongoing, there were a lot of people on the course now as they had finished the bike leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One month before the race, I told Audrey that I was a bit afraid of the marathon, not about finishing it but rather being able to maintain the pace I had in mind. I feared I didn’t run enough kilometers. I would do 40 to 50 km per week, which is not a lot when considering a marathon training plan, but I thought that focusing on bike and swimming would be more beneficial. Well, it turned out I was right, the last 10 km were really tough! After 30 km, I could feel my thighs had become as hard as rocks, and they felt really achy. I didn’t feel like I didn’t have energy, just that my muscles were burnt. On top of that, it started raining, like heavy rain, we were all soaked to the bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then used one of the things for which I made a lot of improvements lately. It took me 30 years to realise how powerful emotions are, how to listen, understand and make the most of them. I would describe myself as cold blooded, that’s not the case anymore. During such a long race, you experience pain, suffering, motivation, despair, determination, euphoria and so many more emotions. What you do with them can totally change your race. I can’t remember how many times I finished some workouts in tears, because the intensity was so high and it would take all I had to go through the pain. But using emotions helps you go way further than what you think, where physical pain is no longer a limitation. It’s disturbing, you feel ridiculous for crying on your bike, but it feels so good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I used it all, all the emotions, the support from the people on the race, the shot of love and adrenaline each time I passed by my little family. The pace had slowed down a bit, my body was hurting and begging to stop, but I hanged on and thought about all my family and friends who were following the race on the IRONMAN tracker! There’s no way I will stop. 35, 36, 37, less and less kilometers to go, 38, 39, 40, last aid station, 41… one kilometer, just one to enjoy the present, the race that went almost according to plan, the feeling you gave it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t see the finish line yet but I was already crying. I sprinted through the last climb, I saw Audrey on the side next to the red carpet. My body was moving on its own, I barely remember these moments, I can only remember when I crossed the finish line, jumping and screaming my happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Audrey after the finish line, took my daughter in my arms, I was exhausted but so happy. One of the athletes who arrived just before me was in the same emotional state, he was French and we would later realise that on top of being a super nice guy, we were going to share the two first places on the podium, amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the pace slowing down at the end, I did the 3rd time on the run with 3h05’, I said that was my specialty 😂 Time to rest now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days have passed since the race, the soreness is gone but I’m still a bit euphoric. I am really proud and pleased about my performance, and even more about my qualification to Hawaiï for the IRONMAN world championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot end this report without saying thank you a million times to all the people who were with me (even remotely) during that journey, my family and friends. All I can say is I love you, I am deeply happy to have such wonderful people in my life. I said it a lot of times to Audrey, it felt weird and I was embarrassed to receive so many messages just for me. I’ll say it again, I was really (really really) touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank my running club LHSA, my local town Mannevillette and my employer Doctolib for supporting me in my adventures, and it’s not over yet! Thank you so much Nathalie for letting me swim in the Château du Bec lake, it&amp;rsquo;s been awesome! hank you again and again to Rosalie from LibreForme8, my nutrition angel 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in Hawaiï, aloha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/ventouxman-2020/&#34;&gt;Ventouxman&lt;/a&gt;, here I am again for another race for the Deauville Triathlon on Sunday the 27th of September. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been long enough to recover from the previous race, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t miss an opportunity to race in 2020 as so many races were cancelled. That one was originally scheduled in June (and postponed in September), and I chose to do the Olympic distance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1500m Swim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40km Bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10km Run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arrête tout de suite avec les &amp;ldquo;ah mais c&amp;rsquo;est facile pour toi c&amp;rsquo;est super court comme format&amp;rdquo; 😑. Une fois pour toutes, ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas une question de distance mais d&amp;rsquo;intensité. L&amp;rsquo;intensité de l&amp;rsquo;effort diminue avec l&amp;rsquo;allongement de la distance 🤓, donc plus c&amp;rsquo;est court plus l&amp;rsquo;effort est violent, donc c&amp;rsquo;est loin d&amp;rsquo;être plus facile. Faites le test, courez tranquillement pendant 40 min et courez à fond pendant 10 min, on verra lequel est le plus cool 😛.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bref, vu les conditions du week-end dernier j&amp;rsquo;espérais un peu de soleil, mais la Normandie n&amp;rsquo;était pas de cet avis. Du vent avec de bonnes rafales toute la semaine, un bonheur. Le samedi avait lieu d&amp;rsquo;autres formats de course à Deauville (une distance découverte et une distance L), et l&amp;rsquo;organisation a dû annuler la natation vu la hauteur des vagues dans la mer. On croise les doigts (🤞) quand même mais le beau temps n&amp;rsquo;est pas annoncé pour le dimanche, on verra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce qui devait arriver arriva, arrivé sur place le dimanche, du vent et un peu de pluie, avec une mer toujours aussi houleuse, la natation est donc remplacée par de la course à pied (comme pour les autres épreuves), c&amp;rsquo;est donc le duathlon de Deauville finalement. Ce sera 3km de course à pied à la place de la nage.
Ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui que j&amp;rsquo;essaierai ma nouvelle combinaison (je désespère). Je me réjouis quand même, la course aura lieu, j&amp;rsquo;ai un car entier de supporters 🥰, je vais enfin faire une course avec Benjamin (depuis le temps), j&amp;rsquo;ai reçu mon nouveau vélo la veille (même si je sais pertinemment que ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas une bonne idée de l&amp;rsquo;utiliser si tôt, mais au moins je le sais 😅), et il fera moins froid que sur le Ventouxman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dépôt des affaires dans le parc à vélo (j&amp;rsquo;ai bien mon porte dossard? Oui 😅), il y a beaucoup de sables et de petites dunes qui se sont formées à cause du vent, ça va faire mal aux jambes pendant les transitions, et ça met surtout des grains de sables dans la transmission du vélo (et ça c&amp;rsquo;est mal, surtout sur un vélo tout neuf 😭). Le vélo de Benjamin est à quelques mètres du mien, et on rigole en disant qu&amp;rsquo;on va pouvoir mettre nos blagues en oeuvre. Le premier arrivé dans le parc à vélo pour la transition pourra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlever la selle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couper les lacets des chaussures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voler une des chaussures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dégonfler les pneus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cacher une barre énergétique dans une chaussure (ah non déjà fait)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On s&amp;rsquo;amuse comme on peut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direction le départ sur la plage, avec les 500 premiers mètres de la course à pied dans le sable, génial! Je commence à m&amp;rsquo;échauffer sérieusement, le début de course va être assez rapide et je prévois de faire les 3km en 3&#39;30&amp;quot;/km (environ 17km/h), pour ne pas laisser trop d&amp;rsquo;énergie avec le passage dans le sable et pour ne pas être trop fatigué sur le dernier 10km. L&amp;rsquo;organisation annonce l&amp;rsquo;ouverture des sas de départ pour dans quelques minutes, j&amp;rsquo;ai encore le temps.
Les concurrents sont censés se placer dans les sas correspondant à leur niveau, afin que chacun y trouve son compte, mais on sait comment ça se passe 😅.
Environ 15 secondes plus tard les sas sont ouverts (on a pas la même notion de &amp;ldquo;quelques minutes&amp;rdquo;), je me retrouve donc en pleins milieu de la foule, et je dois donc demander aux gens de se pousser pour pouvoir être dans les premières lignes. Parce que oui au bout d&amp;rsquo;un moment quand on s&amp;rsquo;entraîne on sait qu&amp;rsquo;on va avoir plus de monde derrière soit que devant, sans prétention bien évidement, et si on veut &amp;ldquo;faire sa course&amp;rdquo; et ne pas être gêné par les moins rapides, il faut se mettre devant.
Sauf que le sas est petit et qu&amp;rsquo;il y a beaucoup de monde, je me retrouve avec une bonne centaine de personnes devant moi, et je n&amp;rsquo;ose pas leur demander pour passer devant 😓
Il faudra vraiment que je me fasse violence pour les prochaines courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le départ est donné (enfin pour ceux qui sont sur la première ligne 😓), 6 athlètes partent toutes les 6 secondes. C&amp;rsquo;est&amp;hellip; long. Quelques minutes plus tard je pars enfin. Le sable n&amp;rsquo;est pas trop mou donc on peut tout de même courir assez vite mais je reste prudent. Je double les gens que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas osé doubler dans le sas, et on arrive sur le bord de plage, on peut enfin relancer. Il y a beaucoup de gens devant et je passe donc mon temps à slalomer pour doubler. Première partie finie en 12&#39;57&amp;quot; à 3&#39;36&amp;quot;/km de moyenne, un peu moins rapide que prévu mais le sable ralentit beaucoup, et au moins je n&amp;rsquo;ai vraiment pas eu l&amp;rsquo;impression de forcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;rsquo;attrape mon vélo et mon casque et m&amp;rsquo;extrais tant bien que mal des dunes pour rejoindre la sortie du parc à vélo, je saute sur ma selle et en avant! Le parcours vélo est assez technique avec de grosses bosses, pas un tracé que j&amp;rsquo;affectionne mais on fera de son mieux! J&amp;rsquo;avais prévu de faire environ 290 Watts de moyenne sur cette partie, puisque je savais que je pouvais tenir sur environ 1h et faire une bonne course après (cf la &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.ironmanvirtualclub.com/en/challenges/details/20-06-ironmanvr10championshipseries&#34;&gt;course virtuelle IRONMAN&lt;/a&gt; en Juin dernier).
Première difficulté après 2km, la côte de Saint Laurent avec 1km à 15% (le col du ventoux c&amp;rsquo;est facile à côté), je garde les yeux sur mon capteur de puissance, 400 Watts&amp;hellip; tout va bien 😅 Certains cyclistes me dépassent, je me dis qu&amp;rsquo;ils sont soit vraiment bons grimpeurs, soit qu&amp;rsquo;ils font une erreur. Ambiance de folie pendant la montée, on se croirait au tour de France!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je relance après la côte et reprends ceux qui m&amp;rsquo;ont doublé (et qui ont apparemment du mal à reprendre leur souffle ah ah ah 😁), parcours vallonné comme prévu et peu de portions plates pour se mettre correctement dans la position aéro (c&amp;rsquo;est à dire les bras sur les prolongateurs), mais je suis quand même super content d&amp;rsquo;être sur mon nouveau vélo et dans une course!! Un des bénévoles m&amp;rsquo;indique je suis 50ème, c&amp;rsquo;est bien j&amp;rsquo;ai dépassé du monde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Après 10km, j&amp;rsquo;ai des sensations bizarres dans les bras en position aéro, et je découvre en me relevant que les prolongateurs se sont desserrés, c&amp;rsquo;est chaud. Le gars du magasin de vélo m&amp;rsquo;avait dit que ce serait normal que les serrages bougent un peu au début avec du matériel tout en carbone.
J&amp;rsquo;avais bien fait les réglages avant la course mais avec les dos d&amp;rsquo;âne et les trous dans la route c&amp;rsquo;était prévisible. Je me dis que ça va le faire, puis au bout d&amp;rsquo;un kilomètre je me dis que non, je vais finir par terre. Je m&amp;rsquo;arrête donc sur le côté, sors mon petit kit de réparation et resserre tout proprement.
Je me dis que j&amp;rsquo;aimerai bien qu&amp;rsquo;il ne m&amp;rsquo;arrive aucune aventure pendant un triathlon, au moins UNE fois dans ma vie. Mais ça ferait des rapports de course moins sympa.
Je repars avec plus de 2 min de perdue, je redépasse les gens que je venais de dépasser, et essaie de faire ma course correctement. Après 30km un des bénévoles me dit que je suis 30ème, c&amp;rsquo;est cool! La route est assez mouillée et il y a pas mal de feuilles par terre, il faut donc rester vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le reste du vélo s&amp;rsquo;est fait sans encombre, même si j&amp;rsquo;ai eu du mal à garder une allure stable. Les quelques bosses font vraiment mal aux jambes et j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression que ça va impacter la course derrière, donc je reste sur la réserve. Bonne fin de parcours où nous étions 5 coureurs avec à peu près le même niveau en vélo, c&amp;rsquo;était cool! Dernière descente à plus de 80km/h 😨 et on arrive de nouveau sur la plage de Deauville.
Je mange ma dernière barre énergétique à la datte (qui sera dans mon ventre et pas dans ma chaussure), elles sont vraiment très bonnes (et je les fais moi même, donc c&amp;rsquo;est encore meilleur). Beaucoup plus de supporters ici, j&amp;rsquo;entends ma mère me crier &amp;ldquo;Come on, that&amp;rsquo;s my boy!&amp;rdquo; 🥰🥰 et on remet un coup dans les pédales pour aller encore plus vite, parce qu&amp;rsquo;on est fier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;rsquo;aperçois l&amp;rsquo;entrée du parc à vélo, je retire mes chaussures à l&amp;rsquo;avance, et je saute pied nus sur le sol en passant la ligne d&amp;rsquo;entrée du parc, 10/10 en style. Je rejoins mon emplacement en me disant que le parc est quasiment vide, c&amp;rsquo;est bon signe pour le classement. Je finis le vélo à 250 Watts de moyenne, donc loin des 290 Watts prévus, il faudra que je m&amp;rsquo;entraine plus sur des parcours de ce type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je déboule sur la course à pied avec en tête une espérance de chrono de 35&amp;rsquo; sur les 10km, les jambes vont très bien mais il y a beaucoup de vent et des passages dans le sable, ça va être dur de tenir la cadence. Je pars en 3&#39;40&amp;quot;/km (16,5km/h) et je commence à rattraper le peu de concurrents déjà sur la course à pied.
Je passe devant mes supporters 😍 (encore plus motivés que moi!), ça fait chaud au coeur! Première boucle de 5km (sur deux) passée en 18&#39;30&amp;quot;, l&amp;rsquo;allure est bonne malgré le vent. Deuxième passage devant les supporters (encore plus bruyants qu&amp;rsquo;au premier tour 😂), je rejoins un autre participant qui court à la même vitesse, et je décide d&amp;rsquo;accélérer sur le dernier kilomètre, j&amp;rsquo;ai décidément un peu trop géré la course 😐.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je termine la course à la 14ème place sur 1023, bon résultat malgré les erreurs que j&amp;rsquo;ai faites (mais qui font partie de la course), je sais maintenant que si je veux arriver près du podium, il faut prendre ses responsabilités. Bonne course dans l&amp;rsquo;ensemble, ce format n&amp;rsquo;est pas trop fatigant pour le corps donc ce sera un exercice à reproduire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une fois encore merci à mes incroyables supporters que sont ma famille, ça semble évident mais les encouragements sont tellement puissants dans une course. Merci à mon entreprise Karhoo et mon club de course à pied le LHSA pour leur support, et toujours Rosalie de &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libreforme8.com/&#34;&gt;Libreforme8&lt;/a&gt;, qui m&amp;rsquo;a donné l&amp;rsquo;idée de ces supers barres énergétiques à la datte (entre autres!). Chapeau à Benjamin et à ses soeurs pour leur performance, ce fut un plaisir de faire cette course avec vous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est temps de se reposer maintenant, 2021 va être chargée!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une année est passée depuis mon dernier triathlon à Nice (pour les championnats du monde Ironman 70.3 à Nice), parce que occupés
à être parents et qu&amp;rsquo;un virus a annulé toutes les courses. Un petit championnat tout de même avec les courses virtuelles Ironman
organisées en juin, mais très différent d&amp;rsquo;une &amp;ldquo;vraie&amp;rdquo; course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bref me voici engagé dans la course du Ventouxman avec l&amp;rsquo;un de mes amis Matthieu, avec au programme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 km de natation dans le lac de Lapalud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90 km de vélo, avec l&amp;rsquo;ascension du Mont Ventoux (donc un total de 2300m D+, c&amp;rsquo;est&amp;hellip; beaucoup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 km de course à pied en forêt, avec 400m D+ et des passages assez techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avec un an de triathlon en plus dans les jambes, j&amp;rsquo;ai hâte de voir les progrès que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu faire sur le vélo, même si l&amp;rsquo;entraînement
fut loin d&amp;rsquo;être optimal. L&amp;rsquo;objectif était surtout de voir où en était la machine et de prendre le départ avec l&amp;rsquo;un de mes meilleurs amis (Matthieu), ça rajoute du plaisir et des souvenirs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrivés sur place la veille, le protocole anti Covid rend le dépôt des vélos plus rapide, au moins ça de gagné en énergie perdue à attendre.
Mon emplacement vélo est juste à la sortie de la natation, juste à côté des vélos des pros 😁, bon point quand on sort de l&amp;rsquo;eau un peu étourdi! Dernière étape, dépôt du sac pour la course à pied, et pendant la conversation, Matthieu me parle du porte dossard, et là&amp;hellip; je m&amp;rsquo;exclame &amp;ldquo;J&amp;rsquo;ai oublié mon porte dossard à la maison le ***&amp;rdquo;.
Matthieu rigole avant de se rendre compte qu&amp;rsquo;il l&amp;rsquo;a lui aussi oublié ah ah ah&amp;hellip; les deux gars super contents de faire la course ensemble et qui ne font pas bien leur sac.
D&amp;rsquo;habitude je suis un vrai militaire sur la discipline et la logistique d&amp;rsquo;avant course, ça m&amp;rsquo;apprendra à me relâcher.
Sauf qu&amp;rsquo;il nous en faut absolument un, on se rend dans les stands de la course, aucun porte dossard, on se dit donc qu&amp;rsquo;on va aller au Décathlon le plus proche.
Il est pas loin c&amp;rsquo;est cool, je dis en rigolant à Matthieu &amp;ldquo;Ce serait drôle qu&amp;rsquo;il y en ait plus qu&amp;rsquo;un&amp;rdquo; ah ah ah. Ah ah ah&amp;hellip; 😅 parfois c&amp;rsquo;est bien de se taire.
Je propose à Matthieu de se battre (en toute amitié) pour savoir qui aurait le porte dossard, mais il refuse en rigolant (parce qu&amp;rsquo;il sait très bien qu&amp;rsquo;il va perdre).
On demande au vendeur s&amp;rsquo;ils n&amp;rsquo;en ont pas en stock, la réponse est non forcément.
Direction le Décathlon à 20min de route, où on trouve enfin un autre porte dossard,sauvés!
Que de stress et d&amp;rsquo;énergie perdue&amp;hellip; On rejoint la maison pour se détendre et préparer les affaires pour le lendemain, avec nos compagnes respectives et baby 🥰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Départ de la course à 7h40, donc levés à 5h45, ce sera Pauline qui nous déposera sur le lieu du départ pour laisser baby dormir.
Deux oeufs, oléagineux et un café, petit déjeuner typique d&amp;rsquo;avant course, et on prend la voiture.
On se raconte qu&amp;rsquo;on a tous entendu l&amp;rsquo;orage pendant la nuit, il reste quelques grondements dans le lointain, mais la météo annonce juste un peu de pluie, pas très grave.
Je préfère cette température que la canicule que l&amp;rsquo;on avait eu sur l&amp;rsquo;Ironman de Nice en 2019. Arrivée au parc à vélo, on regonfle les pneus, on prépare les affaires.
Je rejoins Matthieu à son vélo et commence à mettre ma nouvelle combinaison de natation (que je vais ENFIN pouvoir utiliser dans une course).
Et en même temps commence une douce pluie, qui se transforme quelques secondes plus tard en averse, obligés de s&amp;rsquo;abriter sous les arbres! Les éclairs zèbrent de plus en plus le ciel, et on compte les secondes entre la lumière et le son pour constater que l&amp;rsquo;orage se rapproche de nous, pas bon.
L&amp;rsquo;heure du départ approche mais l&amp;rsquo;organisation temporise, en nous prévenant que l&amp;rsquo;orage devrait nous contourner. Vingt minutes plus tard l&amp;rsquo;organisation nous annonce qu&amp;rsquo;ils vont être obligés d&amp;rsquo;annuler la natation, l&amp;rsquo;orage ne se calme pas (la pluie non plus) et nager dans ces conditions est trop dangereux.
Normal, mais extrêmement décevant! Le départ sera donc à 8h15, avec seulement du vélo et de la course à pied. Le problème est que nous avons tous déjà donnés nos affaires d&amp;rsquo;après course, nous sommes donc pour la plupart sous la pluie avec nos affaires de course déjà trempées, et que l&amp;rsquo;on refroidit assez vite.
Quelques minutes plus tard, nouvelle annonce, les conditions au sommet du Mont Ventoux sont très dangereuses, orage, pluie torrentielle, vent à 100km/h et du brouillard, autant dire bien trop périlleux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La décision est actée de réduire le vélo à 75km et d&amp;rsquo;emprunter la montée par Maleucène, et donc de ne pas monter jusqu&amp;rsquo;en haut du Ventoux, dommage. La pluie se calme (mais il pleut toujours), et le départ commence finalement à 8h30. De nombreux participants préfèrent abandonner avant le départ, il faut vraiment se faire violence pour oublier le froid actuel et les conditions de course qui nous attendent.
Je grelotte de froid en m&amp;rsquo;approchant de la ligne de départ, je n&amp;rsquo;ai que ma trifonction (très fine) et mes manchons que j&amp;rsquo;avais prévu au cas où. Deuxième erreur de logistique, il faut tout prévoir pour une course en montage. Je passe devant Matthieu (les départ sont donnés par ordre de dossard croissant), et enfin les premiers coups de pédale, il est temps de se rechauffer un peu!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;rsquo;ai depuis peu un capteur de puissance sur mon vélo, qui me permet de très bien gérer mon allure. Pour les geeks des chiffres, j&amp;rsquo;avais prévu (avec l&amp;rsquo;aide du site &lt;a href=&#34;https://bestbikesplit.com&#34;&gt;bestbikesplit&lt;/a&gt;) de partir sur une moyenne de 250 Watts, que je savais pouvoir tenir plus de 3h et pouvoir faire une bonne course à pied derrière. Il fallait donc rester à 220 Watts sur les 50 premiers kilomètres puis monter à 280 Watts sur la montée du col. Je me cale donc à cette allure, bien posé sur mes prolongateurs. Les jambes ont bien progressé! Je roule entre 37 et 40 km/h sans difficulté, et je double beaucoup de monde. Les choses ont changé depuis Nice, je suis vraiment content! On enchaîne les routes assez plates, le début du parcours est vraiment roulant. J&amp;rsquo;arrive à rester calme bien que les jambes bouillonnent d&amp;rsquo;énergie. La pluie a un tout petit peu cessée, enfin. Première difficulté après 50km ça grimpe fort, je m&amp;rsquo;ajuste à 280-290 Watts et je me dis que ça passe facile. La pluie reprend de plus belle, encore plus fort qu&amp;rsquo;au départ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Première (et dernière parce qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a que de la montée) descente un peu technique, passage que j&amp;rsquo;affectionne particulièrement. Sauf que c&amp;rsquo;est impossible d&amp;rsquo;aller vite, l&amp;rsquo;eau tombe tellement fort qu&amp;rsquo;il y a un torrent sur la route, je me prends beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;eau dans les yeux avec la pluie qui tombe et l&amp;rsquo;eau qui remonte des pneus, mes yeux sont réduits à deux petites fentes, et la visibilité est vraiment réduite. Pour courronner le tout, mes jantes en carbone (qui n&amp;rsquo;offrent déjà pas un super freinage) donnent l&amp;rsquo;impression de freiner dans le vide, je suis obligé d&amp;rsquo;anticiper plus de 100m à l&amp;rsquo;avance pour éviter de me retrouver dans le décors. Pas grave, c&amp;rsquo;est le jeu!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On attaque enfin le plat principal, la montée par Malaucène. J&amp;rsquo;ai choisi de ne pas regarder mon compteur de kilomètre pour rester concentré sur les watts, je n&amp;rsquo;ai donc aucune idée d&amp;rsquo;où est l&amp;rsquo;arrivée, mais ça m&amp;rsquo;aide à rester dans le présent. On grimpe, on grimpe, la pluie n&amp;rsquo;arrête toujours pas de tomber, ça ressemble plus à du kayak que du vélo. Je suis plutôt bien, les jambes sont ok, j&amp;rsquo;ai chaud et je me nourris régulièrement. Sauf que quand on grimpe, la température descend, et on grimpe&amp;hellip; doucement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vers la moitié de la montée, je me rends compte que mes doigts sont plus proches du bleu que du blanc, et j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression d&amp;rsquo;avoir les bras et les pieds engourdis.
Pas vraiment une impression puisque 10min plus tard je me dis que je commence vraiment à avoir froid, alors que je monte toujours à 290 Watts (environ 90% de ma FTP, donc grosse intensité). Je vois le camion de la croix rouge passer, je pense que certains font de l&amp;rsquo;hypothermie. Quelques kilomètres plus haut, mon souffle fait de la vapeur d&amp;rsquo;eau avec le froid et la pluie, et je n&amp;rsquo;ai vraiment plus aucune sensation dans les pieds et les mains.
J&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression d&amp;rsquo;être en Normandie en plein hiver! La course se corse un peu, mais je vois une borne sur le côté indiquant la fin de la montée dans 5km, ouf!
Quelques coups de pédales plus tard je vois l&amp;rsquo;entrée du parc de transition, et je suis obligé de m&amp;rsquo;arrêter avant la ligne pour déchausser, impossible de desserer mes chaussures avec les doigts gelés.
Je cours tant bien que mal jusqu&amp;rsquo;à mon emplacement, je tremble de froid et j&amp;rsquo;ai du mal à calmer ma respiration. C&amp;rsquo;est la première fois de ma vie que j&amp;rsquo;ai aussi froid (et pour ceux qui me connaissent j&amp;rsquo;ai globalement toujours chaud). Je change de chaussures avec quelques cris de douleurs, et je m&amp;rsquo;élance pour la course à pied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les 20km ont été réduits à 15km, donc seulement 3 tours de 5km. Première expérience de course à pied avec les pieds et les jambes gelées, franchement à éviter 😅 j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression d&amp;rsquo;être Forest Gump avec ses armatures métalliques lorsqu&amp;rsquo;il était petit. Mon souffle est toujours saccadé, je tremble pendant que je cours et mes jambes sont tellement froides qu&amp;rsquo;elles se contractent erratiquement, et surtout douloureusement.
Je suis obligé de faire des tous petits pas pour éviter les crampes et les douleurs. Bonne nouvelle par contre, le parcours est vraiment très cool, et le peu de coureurs m&amp;rsquo;indiquent que je dois être assez bien placé! 5km plus tard la chaleur revient enfin, et je peux enfin reprendre une vraie foulée. Je redouble les participants qui m&amp;rsquo;avaient doublés pendant mon tour de (ré)chauffe, je vais pas me laisser abattre!
Passage du premier tour sous les encouragements d&amp;rsquo;Audrey, Pauline et baby, ça ravigote! Deuxième tour avec de biens meilleurs sensations, et surtout une sensation étrange dans la chaussure gauche, parce que j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression qu&amp;rsquo;elle est pleine de terre (logique puisque l&amp;rsquo;on court dans la boue). Puis je réfléchis et me souviens que pour préparer les transitions, je mets dans mes chaussures ce dont j&amp;rsquo;aurai besoin pour éviter de fouiller dans le sac. Je compte les barres énergétiques que j&amp;rsquo;ai dans ma poche dorsale (dattes et noix de cajou 🤤, une, deux&amp;hellip; Où est la troisième? Voilà voilà, c&amp;rsquo;est donc de la datte que je sens entre mes doigts de pied, et que je vois ressortir par les mailles de la chaussure, classe. Une bonne histoire à raconter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troisième et dernier tour, je déroule et je me sens bien, un quatrième tour ne m&amp;rsquo;aurait pas dérangé, même dans ses conditions. Je suis quand même content d&amp;rsquo;en terminer, le froid m&amp;rsquo;a vraiment fait mal.
Je passe la ligne en 4h19 et finis en 49ème position. Nous étions 850 inscrits, seulement 530 ont terminé (entre les non partants et les abandons, c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;hécatombe).
Le niveau devant était vraiment élevé, j&amp;rsquo;aurai peut être gagné quelques places sans le froid, mais je pense que je suis à ma place. J&amp;rsquo;attends l&amp;rsquo;arrivée de Matthieu, qui a l&amp;rsquo;air vraiment serein, il a vraiment progressé aussi, c&amp;rsquo;est top!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une super expérience malgré les conditions dantesques, mon seul regret est de ne pas avoir pu profiter du paysage, parce qu&amp;rsquo;on ne voyait absolument rien.
Apparement je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas été le seul à avoir quelques mésaventures, puisque Matthieu a crevé. Après 5km de course 😆 Il faudra revenir! Place à la récup et à la prochaine course le week-end prochain (avec un PORTE DOSSARD!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enorme merci à nos supportrices (😍😍), à mon entreprise Karhoo pour son support, à mon club de course à pied le LHSA, et toujours Rosalie de &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libreforme8.com/&#34;&gt;Libreforme8&lt;/a&gt;, pour ses conseils si efficace pour ma nutrition et mon hydratation. Et surtout merci à Matthieu d&amp;rsquo;avoir fait cette course avec moi, un super moment de partage.&lt;/p&gt;
