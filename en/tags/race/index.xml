&lt;h2 id=&#34;little-reminder&#34;&gt;Little Reminder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello, jet lag! It‚Äôs 4 a.m., and I‚Äôm struggling to fall asleep. Well, not struggling, really ‚Äì I just can‚Äôt sleep at all, haha.
We returned from Hawai&amp;rsquo;i five days ago now, and I‚Äôm finding it a bit difficult to get back to a stable sleep pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our daughters are coping a bit better, despite a few middle-of-the-night wake-ups. But children adapt faster than we do.
And Audrey‚Ä¶ apparently not affected by jet lag ‚Äì she‚Äôs so annoying üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, we were already in Hawai&amp;rsquo;i for the same reason: the IRONMAN World Championship.
While there were many similarities with this trip, the adventure didn‚Äôt go so well that time.
I‚Äôll spare you the details (since it‚Äôs all written &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/im-wc-hawaii-2022&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; anyway), but I had to withdraw from the race during the swim.
The next day, I told my wife something like, ‚ÄúThe island has won; I‚Äôll never finish the Hawai&amp;rsquo;i IRONMAN.‚Äù
To which she replied that I couldn‚Äôt let it end on that failure and that I‚Äôd regret it for the rest of my life.
She was right, of course (have I mentioned she‚Äôs almost always right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we got back to work, and in the meantime, so much happened again.
I qualified again for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i (because otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt be writing this report) at IRONMAN Florida, where I took ü•à in my age group.
I then raced at IRONMAN Austria this past June to prepare for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i, where I took ü•á.
I knew I was in good shape, but I didn‚Äôt expect to take such a sweet revenge on this course (I‚Äôd had to withdraw the year before due to a recurring heel issue).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;mental-coaching&#34;&gt;Mental Coaching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started a journey I should have embarked on a long time ago: I took care of my head.
No, I didn‚Äôt go to the hairdresser, but I made an appointment with a psychologist and mental coach, Laure Calviac.
By a twist of fate, my manager at Doctolib (hi, Flo!) mentioned a partnership our company has with Moka Care, a mental health prevention platform.
He told me that each employee gets four free sessions with any mental health professional, no matter the issue.
Perhaps it was destiny giving me a little nudge, but I found the right person and started my first session the following week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs honestly (REALLY) fascinating! I won‚Äôt bore you with the details of my life (even though I sort of am by writing this),
but there‚Äôs so much to explore and understand in your own mind. Sure, the initial focus was on athletic performance, but that‚Äôs inherently
linked to our psychology. Many sessions ended up delving into life events that shaped me as both a man and an athlete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mental profiling, imagery, visualisation, confidence anchoring, mindfulness, cardiac coherence ‚Äì
these are just a few of the tools you learn to use to be at your mental best on race day (and in training, and ultimately, in life ü§£).
For anyone interested, I could talk about this for hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I unlocked so much in my mind in such a short time, thanks to Laure‚Äôs work. Thank you! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;osteopathy-and-contracture&#34;&gt;Osteopathy and contracture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve also set up regular check-ups every three months or so with Pierre-Antoine (whom you obviously know), my physiotherapist/osteopath.
When you train almost every day (well, every day except for rare exceptions), it‚Äôs crucial to address minor aches as quickly as possible
and anticipate tensions that build up over time (for instance, due to a heel operation ‚Äì haha ‚Äì or a weakness in my ribs that sometimes pop out ‚Äì haha).
The advantage of regularly seeing your osteopath is that they get to know you really well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every session, he releases my left ankle, rebalances my diaphragm, and relaxes my back (especially where my ribs popped out that one time!).
Thank you for your work, Pierre-Antoine ‚Äì it‚Äôs definitely helped me avoid major injuries.
Because, let‚Äôs be clear, the top priority in triathlon (and in all sports, really) is not getting injured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a bit of a fright with my calf at the beginning of September ‚Äì a nasty muscle cramp during a run that was nothing out of the ordinary.
It was the first time in my life I‚Äôd experienced a cramp like that, and to be honest, I didn‚Äôt even know what it was.
I took it easy in the days that followed, thinking it was just muscle fatigue like soreness,
but it didn‚Äôt go away at all ‚Äì to the point where I couldn‚Äôt run anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to worry a bit, so I did some research online (don‚Äôt pretend you‚Äôve never done the same ‚Äì I know you!).
I realised it was very likely a muscle contracture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A contracture is the body‚Äôs self-protection mechanism: when it senses a muscle is about to tear,
it contracts that muscle very tightly and prevents it from relaxing to avoid injury. It basically means rest and relaxing the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit, I had a moment of doubt. I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night, picturing having to cancel Hawai&amp;rsquo;i because of a muscle tear
(which would take a good three weeks to heal) ü§¶. But in the middle of the night, I used my mental preparation tools,
planned out my next steps for the following day, and calmed myself down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I called my favourite physio, Antoine, and my sister Emilie
(who‚Äôs now a sports doctor as well as a gynaecologist ‚Äì and I‚Äôll admit, the sports medicine part is much more relevant to me!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, Antoine was on holiday, so it was Victor (who works in the same practice as Antoine ‚Äì and Pierre-Antoine too, for that matter; hope you‚Äôre keeping up!)
who stuck a tiny needle into my calf to release the tension. And it worked perfectly ‚Äì three days later, the pain was gone,
and I could get back to training without any problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs so reassuring to have such great medical support ‚Äì thank you, team! üôè&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;arrival&#34;&gt;Arrival&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, back to the point ‚Äì here we are, ready to head off to the Big Island again. We‚Äôre acclimatised to the heat (despite the dreadful weather we had in Normandy in September). This time it‚Äôs even better: we‚Äôre travelling with our two daughters, my sister Emilie, and also Lys√©a, our niece (her trip to Hawai&amp;rsquo;i is her 18th birthday present ‚Äì not bad, right?), along with Jason, my sister‚Äôs partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To top it all off, we‚Äôll be meeting up there with Adrien Boullier and his family. He‚Äôs my mate from HAC Triathlon, and he‚Äôs qualified for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i too (for the fourth time ‚Äì he‚Äôs a regular üòÖ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our previous trip was‚Ä¶ eventful, to say the least ‚Äì problem after problem. But this time went so smoothly it‚Äôs barely worth mentioning. Then again, we‚Äôre starting to get used to travelling, so logistics aren‚Äôt much of an issue anymore. That said, just to show it wasn‚Äôt entirely easy, Emilie and Jason were a bit short on time arriving at the airport and made it ‚Äújust‚Äù 20 minutes before boarding. It was a close call!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The girls were adorable on the flight. Sure, P√©n√©lope climbed on the seats a bit, but she‚Äôs only two and a half ‚Äì poor thing, it‚Äôs a long journey to Hawai&amp;rsquo;i. I think the worst of it was for Jason, though, who‚Äôs not exactly a fan of flying (yep, I‚Äôm calling him out, and I‚Äôm not done yet!).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-avion&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-9.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-9.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Kona like seasoned pros. Audrey and Emilie went to pick up the vehicles, while the rest of us handled the luggage ‚Äì not a drop of sweat shed. We headed to our accommodation in Waikoloa, the same place as two years ago. It‚Äôs slightly removed from the hustle and bustle of the race, and it‚Äôs absolutely perfect for the kids. Honestly, we almost had the confidence of people who go to the same place every year üôÑ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting to the time difference was a bit tricky (for me and the girls, not Audrey, of course), but everything‚Äôs fine! The first training sessions felt a bit sluggish ‚Äì no surprise after over 20 hours of travel ‚Äì but I‚Äôm feeling calm. I‚Äôve prepared well, both physically and mentally, for this event, and I trust in my preparation. I realised how different things are compared to last time, and I think I mentioned more than once to those around me that it feels like a completely different person will be lining up at the start this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I crossed paths with some pros during training ‚Äì it‚Äôs so cool! It‚Äôs funny to find yourself right next to the guys you watch on YouTube at home üòÄ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did part of a cycling session with Adrien ‚Äì just enough time to chat a bit and take a photo to make everyone at the club jealous! It‚Äôs so awesome to share this experience with him ü§ó.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We made the most of the island, the beach, and the ocean ‚Äì the water‚Äôs warmer than when we go to the pool in France! We even went swimming with manta rays at night (one of the most incredible experiences of my life). In short, living the dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to top it all off, my coach, Romain Guillaume, joined us three days before the race! He hadn‚Äôt been sure if he could make it, but with three of his athletes competing in the IRONMAN, he booked his tickets at the last minute. I offered him the sofa bed, so there he was, showing up on Wednesday night ü§£. We‚Äôve been working together for two years, but this was the first time we met in person. And what better way to make a first meeting unforgettable than on the other side of the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To give you an idea of what he‚Äôs like, he did the IRONMAN Malaysia three weeks earlier (competing in the pro category, even though he‚Äôs technically ‚Äúretired‚Äù), flew back to France, and then almost immediately set off again for Hawai&amp;rsquo;i. It felt like he barely slept, yet we were running, swimming, and he was preparing training plans for his other athletes. He‚Äôd head out at 6 a.m. in Kona to meet his sponsors and so on. He seems to know everyone there ‚Äì you couldn‚Äôt walk 20 metres without him bumping into someone he knew. Absolutely incredible ü§£. Bursting with energy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penny was a bit scared (which is totally normal at two and a half with all that noise!), but Livia ran the whole race. She really did run, even with her little five-year-old legs ‚Äì I had to run too just to keep up with her! It was SO much fun ü§£. Of course, I‚Äôm pretty sure what they enjoyed most was the aid station at the finish line, with crisps, cookies, apple juice, and sweets. Given how much they ate, you‚Äôd think we don‚Äôt feed our girls üôÑ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;d-day&#34;&gt;D Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then race day arrived. I didn‚Äôt have any trouble sleeping, no issues with waking up (unlike in Finland ü§£), and Rom even jumped into bed to finish waking me up (he jokingly said he would do that the night before, but it turned out he wasn‚Äôt joking!). There‚Äôs not much to say ‚Äì we‚Äôre getting pretty good at organising race mornings. I think the hardest part was for Jason, who‚Äôs not too keen on early mornings. Poor guy üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We headed to the start line. I felt calm, just like I did before the IRONMAN Austria start, which is a good sign. Audrey showed off her driving skills ‚Äì I‚Äôm glad Rom got to witness that ü§£.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final hug and kiss for everyone, Audrey said something to me but I was a bit spaced out (I‚Äôll need to ask her later what she said). I wasn‚Äôt distracted, just focused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good thing about doing Hawai‚Äôi again is that the organisation is pretty much the same! I remembered a little hidden corner with two toilets where no one goes (please keep this secret, and by the way, I‚Äôm not going to tell you exactly where they are), perfect for a pre-race pee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to go back to the tattoo tent to put a tattoo (or a ‚Äútouatouage‚Äù as Penny would say ü§ó ‚ô•Ô∏è) on my second arm. Normally, Audrey does my tattoos (which is just the race number) in the morning, but this time for some reason, I felt like I had wings and decided to do it myself. I forgot to peel off the protective film, so the tattoo was useless‚Ä¶ I got told off. Anyway, back to the tattoo tent, the volunteers were super nice, we had a little chat, and the lady struggled to get the ‚Äò4‚Äô the right way round. She missed three times in a row, so the ‚Äò4‚Äô ended up half stuck on, and had to be removed each time with alcohol and a bit of scraping ‚Äì free waxing, in a way. In the end, she wrote it with a marker ü§£. (If you look closely at my right arm in the race photos, you‚Äôll see the ‚Äò4‚Äô is in marker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed to the bike park, where we were greeted by a row of volunteers (at least fifty of them) who cheered us on and wished us good luck for the race ‚Äì it was really moving ü•π.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found my bike, pumped up the tyres (we deflate them the day before to prevent them from bursting in the heat), but I had a doubt about my rear tyre as it hadn‚Äôt inflated like usual. I figured it was probably just because it wasn‚Äôt my usual pump (they provide bike pumps). I finished setting up my helmet, shoes, and nutrition (two one-litre bottles of water with 240g of carbs and two PF&amp;amp;H 1000 packets each, one bottle of water with one PF&amp;amp;H 1000 packet (electrolytes), three PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gels, and one PF&amp;amp;H gel). That‚Äôs quite a bit of sugar! As Emmanuel, one of my colleagues, once said, given the amount of food I carry, should I be considered a food truck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I checked my rear tyre again, and the pressure hadn‚Äôt changed, so all was good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I headed for the start line, saw all the pros ready to enter the water. They start at 6:30, and my wave is at 6:45, so not too much time to wait. I put a good amount of anti-chafing cream everywhere (because swimming in salty water doesn‚Äôt help!), took a gel, finished my bottle of water and electrolytes (we avoid a repeat of earlier dehydration this season). In races like this where it‚Äôs very hot, we can do ‚Äúpreloading.‚Äù This means drinking more water than usual the day before and the morning of the race, adding electrolytes (sodium + potassium) so the water stays in the body. Honestly, having an extra litre of water already in me and being sure I‚Äôm well hydrated is so important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put on my speedsuit (the swimming suit, not the neoprene one that helps with buoyancy, as it‚Äôs not allowed here due to the warm water, but the one with a hydrophobic coating) and headed to my starting slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten how amazing the atmosphere is at this race! To be honest, I think I was so tense the last time that I was oblivious to everything around me. The start is on the street by the sea, so there isn‚Äôt much space, and with the crowd, it gets really packed. People are cheering us on, high-fiving ‚Äì we almost feel like pros ü§£.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I waved to Adrien‚Äôs partner and his girls, searched for Audrey for a bit but couldn‚Äôt find her, then moved into the start slot. I bumped into Victor, with whom I was on the podium at IRONMAN Florida, and we‚Äôd agreed to meet in Hawai‚Äôi. I was so happy to see him! We chatted for a few minutes, then both went back into our pre-race focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hear the pros start, and a few minutes later, it‚Äôs our turn to enter the water. I&amp;rsquo;ve got a shot of adrenaline just writing this ‚Äì I‚Äôm ready to race again! The water is warm, unsurprisingly, between 28 and 29 degrees. The (virtual) starting line is about 100 metres from the shore, so we swim out to it. We end up in the ocean with around 300 guys in a tight group, no standing (good thing we know how to swim üòÖ), and the organisers‚Äô paddlers take turns in front of us to prevent us from going further. Naturally, with 300 guys full of energy, we‚Äôre not sure whether we‚Äôre swimming in water or testosterone, and we start drifting past the starting line. The guys on the paddles shout at us to move back, then begin raising their paddles shouting ‚ÄúBACK UP! BACK UP!‚Äù‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs tense ü§£.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funniest part is when we started feeling slimy things under our hands. We were in the middle of a jellyfish swarm, the size of a big grapefruit but with long filaments. And, being boys, we started joking around, which quickly turned into jellyfish throwing. It was like a throwback to my football years when I was 10, throwing worms at each other while waiting for our turn to take a shot at goal, and painting ourselves with mud for warpaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with these jellyfish was their filaments‚Ä¶ which sting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got stung on the thigh, foot, and hand, and honestly, it hurt üòì. I heard later that a few athletes had to drop out of the race because of the stings, tough luck for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, everyone is super motivated, and when the cannon goes off, we‚Äôre off at full speed. We push a bit at the start, but more to carve out our space, and even though we take and give a few hits, the swimming goes pretty smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled a bit at first to get into the right rhythm, but I feel like I‚Äôm swimming well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about ten minutes, I do a quick internal check of my body, and everything is fine. My ribs are in the right place, I‚Äôm not in any pain, and my mindset is solid. I have flashes of my thoughts from two years ago, and it makes me a bit sad, but today I have confidence, and I‚Äôm not going to fail. I pass the turnaround point (after 1.9km), marked by a big boat, and I feel strong, and a few meters later I think to myself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never gone this far in the race before‚Äù ü§£ I glance over at the guys on the paddles, expecting to see the man who had helped me on that day, but he‚Äôs not there ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the rest of the swim goes well, the group has spread out, so it‚Äôs easier to swim, and I‚Äôm feeling good. I stay cautious and keep my energy for later, there are still a few kilometers after I get out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later heard that there were dolphins in the water while we were swimming, and they weren‚Äôt far from us. I didn‚Äôt get the chance to see them, that would have been magical. It would have been even more magical to see the sharks that the dolphins had just chased away, and that the organisers were keeping an eye on, haha&amp;hellip; There‚Äôs very (very) little chance that the sharks would come and bite our toes (at worst, I‚Äôd throw a jellyfish at them!), but still, it‚Äôs a bit scary!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get out of the water in 57&#39;03 (I‚Äôd aimed for 57&#39;, so I‚Äôm right on target), the atmosphere is amazing, I run to grab my transition bag, quickly take a gel while putting on my leg sleeves (for aerodynamics AND also to protect myself from sunburn), and I run to my bike. I put on my helmet, stash a few gels in the pockets on my back, check my rear tire (it‚Äôs properly inflated!), put on the lucky bracelet that Paola made for me, and I mount my bike after exiting the transition area. Of course, my shoes are already clipped onto the pedals and held in place by elastic bands so I can slip my feet in while I pedal. No time to waste in transition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And off we go for 180km of cycling. After about 50 meters, the first hill begins, with hordes of spectators. I smiled because I was truly happy to be there, feeling strong, in the sun, on my bike, at the World Championships!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the course is through the city, and I get to see my whole family twice; the girls are gorgeous ‚ô•Ô∏è The megaphone is out, and it‚Äôs full of energy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we go on the Queen K, the &amp;ldquo;highway&amp;rdquo; of Kona. It‚Äôs almost 90km in one direction to Hawi in the north of the island, where we turn around and come back. Simple, brutal, and unforgiving. No shade, volcanic rock all around, and a mix of climbs and descents. Nothing crazy, but it‚Äôs draining. The only real change is the climb to Hawi, which is quite long, and where we face a strong headwind.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;source src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-hawaii-2024-video-8.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remain quite cautious on the way out, I could feel right from the start of the bike that I wasn‚Äôt having my best day, the target watts (240 watts) felt a bit challenging, while it should have been relatively comfortable at the start. Sometimes you have a lingering fatigue, sometimes it‚Äôs the body conserving energy, I‚Äôm not sure how to interpret it, but I know that even if the legs are not at their best, the mind will do what it takes. And even if it‚Äôs not the expected performance, you have to do your best with what you have on the day! So I keep it between 220 and 230 watts, and Rom advised me to stay calm on the way out and push a bit more on the way back. Anyway, it‚Äôs still moving fast, and to my delight, the other athletes are following the drafting rule well. I‚Äôve never seen so many referees (on motorcycles). I even spotted them using their stopwatch to check that overtaking times were being respected, which is great! (NB: when passing another competitor, the overtaking must be completed within 25 seconds, otherwise, you receive a penalty card).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take a bottle of water at each aid station to splash cold water on my head and body because even if the weather is overcast, it‚Äôs still hot! It‚Äôs easy to get a false sense of relief on the bike because you‚Äôre riding, so you have air flowing, but you need to stay cautious, otherwise, dehydration will catch up on the marathon. I reach the climb to Hawi after 90km with an average of over 39km/h, it‚Äôs fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The climb is quite long, and I can really feel that I‚Äôm not in the best shape at all, struggling to push over 280 watts, so I lose some time, but the morale is good. After a final long uphill stretch into a headwind, I reach the turnaround (the only technical part of the race, really ü§∑), and we head back to Kona! It‚Äôs more than 10km of descent with the wind at my back, averaging nearly 55km/h, faster than a scooter, ah ah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The return was‚Ä¶ long! I felt the heat, especially on the head, not overly, but the water bottles at aid stations were always welcome. I followed my nutrition/hydration plan to the letter, so I was sure I wouldn‚Äôt hit a low point. But the watts were so tough to maintain! The last 60 kilometers were into a headwind again, and as spaces opened up, you end up pretty much alone on that long straight line. Riding straight with my head in the aerobars doesn‚Äôt bother me at all, thankfully because the course is quite monotonous. At least we ride with the ocean and volcanoes in the background. We also cross wild goats and donkeys, quite the sight ü§£.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often see less than 200 watts on my watch, which isn‚Äôt great, but I keep going. And I feel like I‚Äôm ‚Äústicking‚Äù to the road towards the end, like when you have big MTB tires. The end of the bike course is approaching, and we start passing the pros who are already on the marathon, and the Kona vibe is back ‚Äî it‚Äôs so cool! I take off my shoes about 200m before the bike dismount zone, and I do a little graceful jump (at least I think so, though it may not have been graceful at all) to start running before the line, and then I‚Äôm back in the transition area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 4 hours and 50 minutes with an average speed of 37.3km/h, I give my bike a little farewell kiss and run towards the transition tent. That‚Äôs when I realize three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The volunteers are still on top of their game in the park, and I feel like a world champion!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It‚Äôs hot, like really, really hot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My legs feel terrible, usually by the time I hit the marathon, I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyay, it‚Äôs the marathon‚Äù and I don‚Äôt feel my legs at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sit down in the tent to put on my running shoes, and have a little fright when a volunteer puts a cold towel around my neck to cool me down ‚Äî totally didn‚Äôt see that coming! ü§£ He apologized, I did too, and we laughed about it. I told him I‚Äôd love a second one because it felt so good! I place my Team GB headband (which my big sister lent me, a headband she got as part of her gear for the 2012 Olympics üòé) under my cap to keep the sweat out of my eyes. I grab my nutrition and off I go for the marathon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, I have to control myself to not go out too fast, but today‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm struggling. My stomach hurts, and my legs are begging me to slow down. It‚Äôs going to be a long one. But I remind myself that this could pass, just like in Austria where I felt totally wrecked after the bike, and two kilometers in, I was running like a gazelle and finished the marathon in 2:57, so patience is key!&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first 10 kilometers were‚Ä¶ long. My usual IRONMAN strategy (which comes from my coach, of course) is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First 10 kilometers, take it easy, stay just below the threshold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next 20 kilometers, hit the planned pace and maintain it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Last 10 kilometers, give whatever&amp;rsquo;s left.
Usually, I start feeling the pain in my legs around 25-30 kilometers, but the marathon is generally well-managed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategies work well when everything goes according to plan, but today, I had to improvise! I was clearly struggling from the very first kilometer, and had to push a bit to maintain my pace. Still, I kept going, but the sensations stayed the same: 4:11 for the first kilometer, then 4:15, 4:17, 4:19, and 4:46 at the 6th kilometer. I started to doubt myself. 36 kilometers left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the course was along the coast, and it was suffocating. It was very humid, and there wasn‚Äôt even a breeze. Honestly, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúDNF is coming!‚Äù I gave myself 5 minutes to complain, and after that, I called on all my mental tools to get back on track. Even when it‚Äôs tough, I reminded myself to stay positive. I had already completed the bulk of the race, I could still run, I wasn‚Äôt in hypoglycemia or dehydration, and even though I had given up on aiming for a great time, I could keep going!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, I cross paths with Audrey and all my supporters, except my sister, who had gone much further along the course. No need to tell Audrey how I‚Äôm feeling ‚Äî she knows me well enough to see from my face and stride that I‚Äôm not in the best shape. A few minutes later, I cross paths with Rom (my coach), and I tell him my stomach hurts. He says, ‚ÄúThe race isn‚Äôt over, be patient, and stay positive.‚Äù Good, I had just told myself the same thing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 10-12 km, we arrive on the Queen K (again), with a little less humidity but still rather hot conditions, especially with the tarmac! They recorded 92% humidity and 52 degrees at ground level. Luckily, we have shoes on. Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s straight ahead, with an alternation of slight uphill and downhill stretches, and you just have to switch off your brain. For the rest of the marathon, it will be a rollercoaster of sensations, one kilometre in 4:15 and the next in 4:40, making it impossible to maintain a consistent pace.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s cool is that I ran into some pros who were on their way back from the marathon, and honestly, judging by some of their faces, it was (very, very) tough for everyone. The marathon has aid stations every 2 kilometres, and that&amp;rsquo;s just about right! Each station is filled with ice, and you mustn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to pour ice into your tri-suit and under your cap. It&amp;rsquo;s so hot that I can barely feel the ice, and it melts before the next aid station because my body is so hot. Missing one is risking heat stroke and having to DNF. It&amp;rsquo;s a race against the heat, and you have to constantly stay soaked to try to cool down. I drank over 15 litres of water during the race, and I think I still lost a few kilos. To make things worse, we often get water in our shoes, which tends to give me blisters from the rubbing. But hey, that&amp;rsquo;s the least of our problems ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And who do I hear shouting in the middle of the Queen K? My sister ü§£ She came all the way to cheer me on, even though there was no one else except at the aid stations. Rom had laughed when she said the day before, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to meet you at the 35-kilometre mark,‚Äù because he didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd actually do it. She ran her own marathon during the race, no less than 14 km of running/walking to see her brother with his face drawn and drenched in sweat. I have no idea what she said to me because I was honestly in terrible shape, but as long as she was shouting at me, it kept me going ü§£ At the end, she told me, ‚ÄúYou&amp;rsquo;re 50th!‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúOverall?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, no, in your age group.‚Äù Tough to hear haha. The thing is, in Kona, every little dip in performance costs you. I&amp;rsquo;m not having a bad race, but the competition is so intense that stopping for 5 minutes means losing 10 places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn‚Äôt stop me from continuing, and I ran all the way to the airport. I must admit, at that moment, it seemed endless. We were slowly approaching 30 kilometres, and judging by the looks on the other runners‚Äô faces, I wasn‚Äôt in the worst shape! I ran a few kilometres with an Englishman, who looked fine but had to stop because of cramps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back on the Queen K for the last 10 kilometres, and I thought, ‚ÄúLast stretch,‚Äù and most of all, I was looking forward to seeing my sister again because I knew she was still at her post! And it exceeded my expectations ü§£ Just before that, I crossed paths with Adrien, who was coming the other way (he started the race almost an hour later), and we had a high five, which gave me a burst of energy! I hear my sister shouting from a distance, encouraging me like crazy, and she tells me I‚Äôve moved up to 40th place. A supporter passing by on a bike (who was French) also cheered me on and complimented my sister for the strength of her encouragements. I kept going and heard my sister still shouting, but getting closer. I thought, ‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt seriously started running to catch up with me, has she?‚Äù In the end, she overtook me, straddling the bike seat of the guy üòÇ She thought the guy knew me, so she asked him to hop on his bike ‚Äî it was magical! The video she made during her ride is definitely worth watching!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s it, the heat has made her lose her mind,&amp;rdquo; when I had promised my mum I‚Äôd keep an eye on my sister ü§£&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was finally able to think about this for the last 7 kilometres on the endless Queen K. I also enjoyed the moment; I was, of course, still struggling, but I knew I was finally going to finish this race that had given me so much trouble. For two years I‚Äôve been thinking about this, and now I was going to close the chapter. I slowly approached the finish line, and honestly&amp;hellip; what an atmosphere. Once again, I understood why this race is iconic and what the end of the course represents. In the end, my legs didn‚Äôt hurt that much, I was far from my expected race pace, so I decided to lengthen my stride. I wasn‚Äôt tired at all, so I finished the last 400 metres at almost 19km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, I didn‚Äôt hear anything at the finish line. Audrey was there with the megaphone, but I was in my own bubble. It‚Äôs a bit hard to describe those moments; I would actually recommend doing an IRONMAN yourself to fully understand. Looking back, I felt fewer emotions than when I finished the IRONMAN in Klagenfurt last June, where I had fought for first place with everything I had. I was very much in tune with myself back then, and once again, I was able to appreciate the personal work I‚Äôve done over the last few months to fully enjoy the moment with mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;end&#34;&gt;End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs done! Finisher of the IRONMAN World Championships in Hawai‚Äôi, in this legendary place. 9 hours and 12 minutes of effort, far from the 8 hours and 45 minutes I had originally planned, finishing in 37th place. I had more ambition, but that will be for another time. And as Rom (yep, him again) would say, even though the performance is poor by my standards, completing 9:12 in Hawai‚Äôi on a bad day is still really, really good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you cross the finish line, a volunteer comes to put a towel around your shoulders, hands you a bottle of water, and walks with you towards the final aid station, and this happens for EVERY triathlete. You really feel privileged. Of course, I ended up with a British volunteer, and we had a good laugh all the way to the tent. As we passed the medical tent, I told her that two years ago, that‚Äôs where I had stopped the race, and that today, I had finally made it to the end. I could tell it really moved her, and I almost made myself cry ü•π Beyond the sport, it‚Äôs so amazing to meet people from all around the world at this kind of event ‚Äî it‚Äôs truly enriching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after a few bottles of water, I was eating fries by the ocean. I wasn‚Äôt too tired, and I was looking forward to meeting my family. I grabbed a nice plate of chips for my girls and set off to find my supporters ‚ô•Ô∏è&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My girls were thrilled to see me, but I think it was really the chips that had that effect, haha. Finally, I truly crossed the finish line when I was able to hug my wife, and I mumbled a ‚Äúwe did it‚Äù ü•π&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sister was there too, and I still don‚Äôt understand how she managed to get back so quickly; maybe she stole the man‚Äôs bike ü§£&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we are, at the end of the story! What an adventure, my friends! To be honest, I was eager to finish the race and move on to the next thing, so we could all rest a little. I thought I could put Hawai&amp;rsquo;i behind me as a great memory and take my foot off the gas. I really believed that, until I crossed the finish line. I thought the fire inside me would calm down ‚Äî wrong! I was even more motivated at the end! Let‚Äôs face it, there will be more race reports to come!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last anecdote before I let you go. When I went to pick up my bike after the race, I noticed that my rear tire was flat üòë. I figured out why I felt like I was dragging towards the end ‚Äî it must have been deflated. Luckily, it was a slow puncture, but still, that was close! üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could I not finish without saying thank you to everyone who supports me in these adventures ‚Äî my family, my friends, my coach Rom ( üòó ), my colleagues (Hello Blue &amp;amp; Green team üíôüíö), the unwavering support of HAC Triathlon (thank you Philippe and the team), my club mates, my medical staff with Antoine and Pierre-Antoine, my mental coach Laure Calviac, my partners at Culture V√©lo Le Havre (if my bike could talk, it would have some thank yous for you, thank you Laurent and the whole team), Aris (thanks Remi Delahais üôè), Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration, AB Sports Piscine and Spa (thanks again Alexandre Baril, an amazing team with whom I‚Äôve spent way too much time chatting at the poolside, no wonder swimming takes so long). Thanks also to Julien Debris for his coaching by the pool, Adrien for his kindness and the pleasure of sharing these world championships with me (we‚Äôre going back whenever you want!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs amazing the number of people you meet over time; it‚Äôs so enriching!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, how could I not thank my little Lysette üòΩ and Jason, who joined us on this journey, my sister Emilie (a thank you will never be enough, but you know what‚Äôs in my heart ‚ô•Ô∏è), and the most beautiful person in my life, who supports me through every moment and helps me grow, without whom this adventure would have never happened. You are the IRONMAN, Audrey, not me ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my daughters ever come across this story, remember that we won‚Äôt be going on holidays to Hawai&amp;rsquo;i every year, haha ü§£. Also, you have far more resources than you think, it will take sweat and effort to tap into them, but it will be worth it, no matter the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, this race was a blast. The result, the experience, and the adventure full of obstacles to get there, I found myself again, and I think I unlocked even more things within me! And to top it off, since it&amp;rsquo;s November, I have a mustache for Movember üòé Doing an IRONMAN with a mustache makes it super special.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months after the half IRONMAN World Championships in Finland in Lahti, where I finally got good sensations, it was time to go for the A race of the season, the IRONMAN Florida. Two objectives here: validate the progress made in training by going under the 9-hour mark (now we‚Äôre talkingl), and secure a second qualification for the IRONMAN World Championships in Hawaii, scheduled for October 2024.  This will give us time to prepare for the trip or plan another race if I fail to qualify. Still, some ambition going in, because I believe I have progressed well, and I think the hard work my coach Romain had me do is starting to pay off. I did three weeks with 21 hours of training per week, which surprisingly went well (probably because the coach and the athlete did their job well!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I was leaving for this destination without my wife and daughters because, you know, between the expenses, the time difference, school holidays, etc., it was a bit complicated. But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t alone, as my sister Emilie would make the trip with me! And because we are great sisters and brothers, we convinced our other sister Chlo√© to join us. In the end, it would be a family trip, even though our big sister Marie was still missing, but that‚Äôs for next time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all met at the Paris airport, and I realised my sisters had prepared a surprise. They prepared badges with our faces on them, announcing that they were my support team, and that we were the &amp;ldquo;Team OG.&amp;rdquo; So cool! We couldn&amp;rsquo;t count the number of people who stared at the badges intently throughout the trip (because we wore them everywhere üòÇ). I even had several people come up to me and ask if I was a professional athlete. The badges were really, really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-a-journey-to-pcb&#34;&gt;What a journey to PCB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the first flight left almost 1 hour late, and we had a connection in Atlanta, with 2 hours to reach the other boarding gate. Sounds like a lot. Except when you arrive in the United States and have to go through customs, pick up your bike suitcase, give it back 100 metres away, go through hand luggage control again, and walk through half of the gigantic airport. We missed the connection by 5 minutes üòë&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s almost 22:00 (local time), and here we are at the airline counter to see what we can do. In the end, we have to wait until the next day to take the first flight at 9:50. At least the airline was quite accommodating; since the delay was their fault, they paid for a night in the hotel of our choice. We also had 2 free meals each at the airport. Considering that the hotel we chose was almost ‚Ç¨400 per night, we slept well! Not too stressed, just tired; the three of us were together, so it was okay.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we arrived in Panama City Beach, PCB as they say there, and the first surprise upon leaving the airport was that it was 9 degrees, and with the wind, it felt even colder.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be cold anywhere, even in Florida! In the end, the weather warmed up during the week. We arrived at our hotel, a 27-story building on the beach, impressive üòÇ It isn&amp;rsquo;t the tourist season, so the building is quite empty, and we have all the facilities just for us: the huge outdoor pool (in case you‚Äôre bored with the ocean), the gym, the jacuzzi, the sauna, the cinema (yes, the cinema, with two films a day), and probably other things we didn&amp;rsquo;t see üòÇ Well, after these travel adventures, the jacuzzi with a direct view of the sun setting over the ocean was very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to the apartment, we even bumped into Arthur Horseau, whom I recognized immediately (he didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize me, despite our super badges!! üòÇüòÇ). It&amp;rsquo;s not often that you can meet an athlete of this calibre (he won the Embrunman and finished 6th in the IRONMAN World Championships in Nice this year) in an elevator. Plus, he&amp;rsquo;s super nice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final training sessions are done, the bike and body are good. On purpose, I eased off with my coach Romain to arrive fresh for the race, and I made the most of this rest to remove the traces of the journey.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-gallerydumb&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-17.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-17.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also developed the habit in recent races of adjusting to the race wake-up time almost a week before, so my body gets used to going to bed and waking up early. It&amp;rsquo;s weird to go to bed at 8:30 pm to wake up at 5 am, but on the morning of the race, you&amp;rsquo;re happy when you&amp;rsquo;ve slept well! Check-in done, everything is ready for the race, and I still have a lot of fun with my sisters; it&amp;rsquo;s really cool to share such a special moment with them. Emilie took over my social medias; I think there has never been so much content in such a short time üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;race-day&#34;&gt;Race day&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race morning, a calm wake-up at 5 am, we are a 10-minute walk from the start, which is at 6:50 am. I had been stressing a lot (like really) the day before and during the first half of the night, until around 1:30 am when I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;whatever happens tomorrow, you&amp;rsquo;ve done everything you could to prepare properly. If there&amp;rsquo;s an unexpected event, we&amp;rsquo;ll see at that moment. The ONLY thing you can do until the start is to sleep as well as possible.&amp;rdquo; Believe it or not, the stress vanished, and I fell asleep like a baby. The power of your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We head to the race start, a brief video call with my wife a couple thousands of kilometres away for a final cheer on, it&amp;rsquo;s 14 degrees outside, so it&amp;rsquo;s okay! The temperature will rise to 26 in the afternoon, so great weather overall! I settle my bike, fill my transition bags, everything is in place, and I&amp;rsquo;m genuinely relaxed; it&amp;rsquo;s cool. We head to the start line; we have the American anthem sung a cappella, it&amp;rsquo;s very moving. Americans are really serious about the anthem; we felt like time had stopped, no one moved! Big hugs with my sisters (quite a few tears from me), the organisation puts some music on: Lose Yourself by Eminem. Big adrenaline rush, I tell myself that I&amp;rsquo;m not here for fun. Fair enough, I won&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistake as in Finland; I go to the very front in the starting line. ALL THE WAY TO THE FRONT. The pro men start at 6:40 am, the pro women at 6:45 am, and us at 6:50 am. So, I started at 6:50 am, not 51, at 50 because I finally took responsibility üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swimming consists of 2 loops of 1900m, with an Australian exit on the sand, why not! The first loop goes very well, the water temperature was 23 degrees, so almost too warm with the wetsuit on, and the rising sun is splendid. I feel a bit of current, but there aren&amp;rsquo;t too many waves, so it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to swim. There are thousands of small jellyfish in the water, it&amp;rsquo;s quite funny to pass my hand through them, it reminds me of jelly üòÇ They don&amp;rsquo;t sting though, so no risk, but talking to other athletes after the race, I&amp;rsquo;m the only one who found it amusing. A quick run on the sand to start the second loop, with my sisters making more noise than the entire audience combined, impressive üòÆ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I completed the first loop in 28&#39;, right on time to redo a 56&#39; swim like in Austria, right on track. I start the second loop, but this time with the whole crowd, because the other athletes haven&amp;rsquo;t yet started in the water. A bit tricky to keep the right pace in the middle of packs of swimmers who aren&amp;rsquo;t swimming as fast as me. I lose a bit of time on the second loop, and finished in 58 &amp;lsquo;51&amp;quot;, a bit slower than planned but still well below what I could do before. Quite satisfied overall.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-galleryt1&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-31.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-31.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No time to wonder, I rush into the bike transition, still fueled by the cheers of my sisters, and with top-notch energy, I feel good. I put my helmet on, grab my nutrition, my lucky charm bracelet (always the same one made for me by Paola üíô), hop on the bike, and I set off for a 180 km ride of flat terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite windy out there on the road, but it&amp;rsquo;s manageable, better than the previous days. For those who would say &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo;s easy when it&amp;rsquo;s flat&amp;rsquo;, go outside and ride 180 km on flat terrain. The subtlety is that if you stop pedalling, there won&amp;rsquo;t be a downhill to maintain speed, so you have to pedal all the time, with zero break. And that can really hurt your legs. The same goes for the aero position on the aerobars; except for a few U-turns or stops at the aid stations, you stay in that position, and it&amp;rsquo;s truly exhausting. I rode all alone (literally all alone) until the first aid station at kilometre 50, without moving out from my aerobars, so about 1 hour and 15 minutes in the same position. I had sore trapezius muscles after the race üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s going well; I catch up with other athletes, including some pro women, they are so impressive üòÆ Again, some of the athletes don‚Äôt follow the drafting rules, but this time I tell  them off myself üòÇ, especially when they try to hide behind me. I don&amp;rsquo;t know where the referees are once again, so be it. Anyway, we&amp;rsquo;re riding strong, and my legs feel good. I&amp;rsquo;m holding the watts I had planned, with the good position I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on and the disc wheel, it‚Äôs going fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scenery is quite nice, but you have to enjoy long straight lines. In the end, I don&amp;rsquo;t really notice the time passing; I stick to my hydration/nutrition plan and make sure to wet myself with water as often as possible. It&amp;rsquo;s getting hot compared to the beginning of the bike, so it‚Äôs better not to start overheating. I started feeling the urge to pee after 3 hours (important detail!), the first time it has happened to me during a race. Let‚Äôs be clear on that, I kept the contents of my bladder INSIDE my bladder. And there you go, that was the standout moment on the bike!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up the bike leg, I&amp;rsquo;m quite satisfied with my performance. I had energy throughout the course, was able to push even towards the end of the 180 km, overtaking a few people who didn&amp;rsquo;t seem as fresh as me. Romain had warned me that I might get tired around 130-140 km and would need to push through, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. Looking back, I might have been a bit too conservative. I already know he&amp;rsquo;s got some surprises prepared for me in next year&amp;rsquo;s bike training sessions! üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finish the bike leg after a final long straight stretch along the seaside, no time to look at the splendid houses. It took me 4 hours, 36 minutes, and 34 seconds to complete 180 km, averaging 39.2 km/h. I&amp;rsquo;ve made good progress üòÇüòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My two sisters are at the bike transition to cheer me on! To be honest I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite catch everything they were saying, because of the wind in my ears, being careful not to fall while getting off the bike, and my urge to pee. Too much information to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head straight to the toilet; I thought it would never end. It actually scared Emilie when she saw me heading that way; she thought I had belly issues. But no, I was feeling great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A smooth transition, moving quickly but making sure not to forget anything. As all coaches say, &amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse speed with haste&amp;rsquo; üòÇ (at least that‚Äôs what French coaches say!) I grab my sunglasses, a cap, my nutrition, and hydration in my hands and start running. I then place them in the right spots (nutrition in the back pockets of the tri suit, cap on my head, etc. you get the idea), a little trick to save time in transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rush out of transition to start the marathon, hearing Chlo√© telling me I&amp;rsquo;m 4th in my age group, the two ahead are less than 2 minutes away, and the first is 6 minutes ahead. Let the hunt start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two loops of 21 km for this marathon. Romain and I had discussed a strategy for the marathon. Start the first 10 km coasting, maintain a good pace for the next 20 km to let fatigue set in, and then let it go (as much as possible üòÖ) in the last 10. The first kilometre feels really good, even at almost 15 km/h, it feels like an easy jog. I manage myself and don&amp;rsquo;t get carried away; I stick to an easy pace, as the coach said. I pass a pro female athlete (a Canadian) who catches up just after, and she asks if I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a sub-3-hour marathon. I say yes. She looks thrilled and asks if she can run with me, why not!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my fantastic experience with Read during the World Championships in Finland, here I am embarking on another adventure with Erin Snelgrove. The kilometres pass effortlessly at 4&#39;09&amp;quot;/km (14.5 km/h), in a controlled stride and taking enough water at each aid station. It&amp;rsquo;s 26 degrees with bright sunshine. It&amp;rsquo;s great to run with Erin; she has a beautiful stride and tells me she&amp;rsquo;s currently 7th among the pros and wants to finish 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We run into Emilie after 13 or 14 kilometres. She tells me I&amp;rsquo;m in 3rd place (I overtook a competitor without realising it), the 2nd is 1 minute ahead but starting to struggle, and the leader is now only 3 minutes ahead. The chase continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End of the first loop, 21 km without a hitch, still with Erin by my side, who tells me that I&amp;rsquo;m a real metronome; it&amp;rsquo;s indeed one of my strengths üòÄ.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-galleryrun&#34; data-caption=&#34;a&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-1.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-florida-2023-1.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head out for the second loop, and I sense after an aid station that Erin is struggling to pick up the pace, she might have a slight dip in energy. I try to wait for her, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t catch up, and with a bit of sadness, I resume my pace. It&amp;rsquo;s still an individual race, and I still have the first two to catch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run pass Chlo√© at 23rd kilometre, who tells me I&amp;rsquo;ve passed the 2nd (I don&amp;rsquo;t know when ü§∑) and that the leader is now only 2 minutes ahead. Three thoughts cross my mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to finish the race easily; I still have energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to chase down the first one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll qualify for Hawaii if I keep this up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, I speed up a bit (0.5 km/h faster) because it feels effortless. A few kilometres later, I see Emilie, who tells me that I&amp;rsquo;m only a minute and thirty seconds behind the first and that Romain told her he has never run a marathon in less than 3 hours, so I have the advantage. She manages to convey all this information and add encouragementon top of it in record time; she spoke so loudly that you probably heard the echo all the way to France üòÇ As I mentioned before, my sisters were an incredible support team! Before the race, we discussed the information I wanted to have during the race and the trigger phrases to motivate me. They executed it perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reach the 28th kilometre, and I start to feel that it&amp;rsquo;s getting challenging, even though I&amp;rsquo;m gradually gaining time. I haven&amp;rsquo;t made the last U-turn for the final 10 kilometres yet. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have leg pain, but I began to feel a bit of fatigue. Even though we&amp;rsquo;re closer to the end of the race than the beginning, 14 km can feel very, very long if you&amp;rsquo;re struggling. The 4&#39;09&amp;quot;/km pace I&amp;rsquo;ve been maintaining since the start slows down to 4&#39;20&amp;quot;/km for 3 km, and the fatigue persists. I get to the next aid station, which is 50 metres before the U-turn, and I think to myself, &amp;lsquo;Okay, you can walk for 5 seconds, then get back to it.&amp;rsquo; I take a good sip of water, walk easily, counting 5 seconds in my head, then resume and make the U-turn. And I was back in the game. I have 10 km left to enjoy and make the most of the end of this race, which has gone exceptionally well so far, to go after the first place and crush my time on the distance. I get back into the right pace, although honestly&amp;hellip; it hurts üòÖ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start a countdown in my head, only 8 kilometers left. 7 kilometers. I pass a guy who looks strong. He has a ton of sponsors on his tri suit. I have a look at his bib, and I see that he&amp;rsquo;s a pro. I&amp;rsquo;ve just overtaken a pro triathlete, even though he started 10 minutes before me. I think he must be having a very bad day, and I also think that I&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress. It&amp;rsquo;s important for my personal pride üòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;500 metres later, I hear the first athlete who is going to overtake me during this marathon, and it&amp;rsquo;s not an athlete but a female athlete. It&amp;rsquo;s Erin, who has finally caught up with me. She says something, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what because I&amp;rsquo;m a bit struggling. However, I stay just behind her and try to hang on. Only 4 kilometres left. I see a tall building not so far away and set myself a goal to get back next to Erin (not behind her) starting from that building. We reach the building, and here we are, side by side again for the final 3 kilometres. There&amp;rsquo;s much more atmosphere in this part of the race, and even though my legs are starting to send me distress signals, there&amp;rsquo;s no way I&amp;rsquo;m slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 kilometre to go, my hamstrings are on the brink of cramping. I&amp;rsquo;m fully focused not to make a misstep; otherwise, I‚Äôm probably going to have a hard time getting back up. Erin picks up the pace even more, breaching by a few metres. I tell her to go on and keep going. Less than a hundred metres to go, I see Chlo√© one last time, who tells me the leader is 20 seconds ahead. A little shot of adrenaline, and I pick up the pace too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last right turn to head towards the end. I see the finish line, and it feels like I&amp;rsquo;ve launched into a crazy sprint. In my head, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm running at least at 20 km/h. In reality, it&amp;rsquo;s 16 km/h üòÇ but not too bad for the end of an IRONMAN marathon. I finished it in 2 hours and 58 minutes. Here‚Äôs the sub 3h marathon! No idea what happens next; I&amp;rsquo;m shattered. A volunteer talks to me and walks with me to the finish tent. I must have told her my life, but I don&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember what. I just recall being really happy with my race, relieved to have finished, and I gave her the bracelet we received as a gift to thank her for participating in organising the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meet Erin just after that; she tells me she finally finished 4th in the race, beyond her expectations! And she says it was so cool to have run together. I can‚Äôt agree more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finished 2nd in 8h42‚Äô04‚Äù, just 50 seconds behind Victor, not 20 seconds. He was indeed 20 seconds ahead of me when Chlo√© saw him (because she actually started a timer when she saw him pass by), but he must have started 30 seconds behind me at the beginning! It just goes to show that in the end, it&amp;rsquo;s the little details that matter. Those 50 seconds are probably about the time I spent in the toilets during the transition after the bike üòë.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to him the next day, he&amp;rsquo;ll tell me he was really scared because his wife told him I was catching up to him. It was close! I jokingly told him we would meet again in Hawaii for a rematch. We both laughed, but we also know we weren&amp;rsquo;t joking at all, and we&amp;rsquo;ll do our best to beat the other ah ah ah üòÇ. We still are competitors even if we respect each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I leave the post-race tent and meet my sisters, and we can all let our emotions out; there&amp;rsquo;s quite a bunch to release üòÇ. I need to sit for a bit at a table because I don&amp;rsquo;t feel great, I&amp;rsquo;m starting to get cold, and I&amp;rsquo;m a bit nauseous, but it goes away in a few minutes. I&amp;rsquo;ve never experienced this after a race, but it makes me realise that I truly gave it all in the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I video call Audrey; I can finally tell her that we did it, and we&amp;rsquo;re going back to Hawaii üòÄ (I&amp;rsquo;m taking a break in writing the report to grab some tissues ahahah). While I was on the phone, my sisters went to get ice cream to recharge. So many emotions during this race!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, I&amp;rsquo;ve shared quite a bit about my life! But there were some adventures to tell. I didn&amp;rsquo;t come to Florida for fun! Now, it&amp;rsquo;s time for the 2024 season, with Hawaii as the highlight, and this time the race report will be a good one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this far. The 2023 season ended on a positive note, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of hope and expectations for the next one üòÄ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can I say, other than a massive thank you to all the people who support me in my adventures‚Äîmy beloved daughters, my family, my friends, my colleagues (current or former), my coach Romain Guillaume, my partners (Tacher Acogex, Culture V√©lo Le Havre, Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration), my physio Antoine, my osteopath Pierre-Antoine, my club the HAC Triathlon, my beloved SRE team üíöüíô (they are direct witnesses of how hard Thursday training days can be üòÇ), my company Doctolib, and my village of Mannevillette (it was so funny when the speaker mentioned my name and village to call me on the podium).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special mention to my two sisters, my crew for this race, who must have been as tired as me after the race given how much energy they spent. We had a lovely week together on another continent, and we have so many new memories. Mum, I took good care of my sisters, and they took good care of me üòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Audrey, even 7,000 km away, you were with me üíôüíôüíô.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Before swim:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T1:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bottles (1L each) with 120g of PF&amp;amp;H mix (120g carbs/2000mg sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 bottle (800 mL) with 1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g &amp;amp; 1 packet of PF&amp;amp;H 1000 (90g carbs/1000mg sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;~3 water bottles (500mL each)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3 PF&amp;amp;H gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T2:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 PF&amp;amp;H gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 soft flask (500mL) with 1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 30g and 1 packet of PF&amp;amp;H 1000 (30g carbs et 1000mg sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 electrolyte capsules (250mg sodium each)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 glass of water (~100 mL) per aid station (20 in total)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that gives around 94,18g carbs, 813mg of sodium and 790mL of water per hour for this race. Quite close to what I did during the race in Finlande, but for twice as long. More sodium and water, but that&amp;rsquo;s not a surprise given the fact that it was hotter (and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t raining!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel Audrey shaking me to wake me up; I slowly emerge from sleep as she whispers, &amp;lsquo;It&amp;rsquo;s 5:30, the alarm didn&amp;rsquo;t ring!&amp;rsquo;. The alarm was supposed to ring an hour ago, and 5:30 was the time we would leave to go to the Half IRONMAN World Championships that morning. With an hour-long drive and the bike park closing at 7:30, we were cutting it close. Another race off to a great start! üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has happened since the big failure in Hawaii last October, and needless to say, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to leave it like that when I returned. Audrey had warned me, ‚ÄúIf you stop here, you&amp;rsquo;ll regret it for the rest of your life.‚Äù And since I always listen to my wife (even if I don&amp;rsquo;t always admit it), we decided on the next steps. Two things came out of it:
Triathlon takes time, and finding the right balance with family and work life is crucial. A 6-hour bike ride on Sunday morning is not exactly a gift, both for the one staying home with the kids and the one heading out to ride. So, if we were going all in on training, we might as well find a way to do it with the least impact. That&amp;rsquo;s where I asked my company (Doctolib) to switch to part time (80%) (another brilliant idea from my wife). And I‚Äôd like to thank them (thanks Florian, Stan, Jad, and Rapha√´l for your trust). Thursdays will now be dedicated to training, and given the sessions I was about to endure, it was a good idea.
Beyond a certain level of performance, there&amp;rsquo;s a quest to maximise training for efficiency. Since training volume is a significant factor in progress, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go wrong with the method. That&amp;rsquo;s why I sought the help of a coach, and that&amp;rsquo;s where Romain Guillaume, a pro triathlete, comes into play. He was highly recommended by Hind, a triathlete I had met in 2019 for the IRONMAN in Finland (hi Hind!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since last November 2022, I got back to work with a lot of dedication and plenty of new advice and methods from Romain. Not a revolution in itself since the principle remains the same. Consistency, progressiveness, and the right mix of volume and intensity at the right times. Not having to decide everything relieves a lot of stress, especially since it can be challenging to be objective when you are coaching yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Romain reassured me and demystified a lot about how to train, especially about the moments when you should stop training. He also brought his pro experience and sessions that I would NEVER have dared to do, because I would have thought it was suicidal (both in terms of injury risks and fatigue). And in the end, it worked üòÇ, even when he schedules a 7-hour training session on a Thursday. Not a scratch. Well, let me rephrase that, I was completely shattered after those sessions, but it would put the rest of the training at risk. Even when the session is titled &amp;lsquo;Brick Run - it&amp;rsquo;s going to hurt!!!!!!!&amp;rsquo; In the end, the coach knows better than we do what we are capable of. &amp;lsquo;Trust the coach, trust the process.&amp;rsquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s be clear, overall everything went well, but there are still sessions where you‚Äôd feel lousy, and everything would be tough even though it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be an easy session. There are moments when you&amp;rsquo;d rather stay warm at home because you&amp;rsquo;re tired and it&amp;rsquo;s raining outside (it never rains in Normandy ah ah‚Ä¶). And the next day, you‚Äôd feel like a war machine during the toughest session of the week. Not easy to understand how our bodies work sometimes üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, having a coach like Romain is a great experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-back-on-2023&#34;&gt;Step back on 2023&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2023, I had four major events:
Vend√¥me (France) triathlon at the end of May (half IRONMAN distance)
IRONMAN Klagenfurt, Austria, at the end of June (to see where I‚Äôm at in my training and try and beat my PB)
Half IRONMAN World Championships in Lahti, Finland, at the end of August (that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re talking about in this report for those who aren&amp;rsquo;t following), thanks to my qualification in Weymouth, England, in September 2022 (where I won in my category, and also for which I didn&amp;rsquo;t take the time to write a race report!)
IRONMAN Florida, USA, at the beginning of November&amp;hellip; to once again qualify for Hawaii in 2024.
A great program!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of the season with cross-country races went quite well, even though I still had heel pain (a result of my surgery a year earlier! Tendons rehabilitation takes a long time), training was going well, and I began to regain confidence.
A second-place finish in the Vend√¥me L triathlon at the end of May confirmed that my form had returned, even though I struggled and was quite disappointed with my run. Some might say, &amp;lsquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s still good to finish on the podium despite not having a good race.&amp;rsquo; Yes, but it&amp;rsquo;s far from satisfying. I made some mistakes that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have, and I really wanted to perform well to get back on track after Hawaii. In short, the race left me with a sense of unfinished business and a slight heel pain, just when I thought I could put that behind me. I felt my heel tingling several times during the run, especially in the trail sections where the ground would be unstable.
The pain was there again when I resumed training, and my physiotherapist (my dear Antoine) confirmed that there was a slight inflammation, nothing very serious but that I would need to be patient. However, the IRONMAN in Austria was just a month away. I did my best during this time to deal with the inflammation; it didn&amp;rsquo;t improve, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t get worse either. I was so accustomed to this pain that it didn&amp;rsquo;t stop me from training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Austria, I had resigned myself to the situation ‚Äì we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it goes during the race! It&amp;rsquo;s a shame because this race also deserves its race report, but honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to do everything, and I can&amp;rsquo;t let myself write something rubbish. Writing a report takes me 5+ hours!. Anyway, aside from the breathtaking landscapes of Austria, I had the best swim of my life in 56 minutes, aiming for less than an hour, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t disappointed. Finally, that feeling of being more like a fish in the water than a stone. I had done a few sessions with Val√©ry (Toupin) before this race, and in my head, I kept telling myself, &amp;lsquo;be a dolphin like Val√©ry.&amp;rsquo; From the inside, it seemed to work; from the outside, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but I was still happy with myself! Smooth transition to the bike and a fantastic 180km course, where I clearly had a great time. Only the last hour was starting to get a bit tough, but I also had the best bike leg of my life in 4 hours and 58 minutes, averaging 36 km/h, cool! Another smooth transition to the run, surprisingly zero heel pain, I was super happy. I covered the first 10 kilometres in 42 minutes, perfect for the goal of under 3 hours on the marathon and under 9 hours in total. I felt really good until my heel pain came back. I gritted my teeth, then started to slow down, then limped more and more. That&amp;rsquo;s when I told myself two things:
I&amp;rsquo;ll finish the first loop (the race consisted of 2 loops of 21km) because Audrey is waiting for me there, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want her to worry.
I&amp;rsquo;ll stop the race here. I know I can finish it, but if it&amp;rsquo;s going to damage my heel, it&amp;rsquo;s not worth it. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t a major race (except for chasing a time), and the rest of the race went very well.
So, I stopped at kilometre 21, but without regret and with a clear conscience. Audrey was much more disappointed than I was! I just remember telling her, &amp;lsquo;My heel hurts; there&amp;rsquo;s no point in continuing. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit frustrating. Plus I&amp;rsquo;m not even tired.&amp;rsquo; And it was true; I wasn&amp;rsquo;t particularly tired, not even sore legs. A good sign, the preparation was really good. But we&amp;rsquo;re not here to talk about Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sponsors&#34;&gt;Sponsors!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, THREE great pieces of news came in ‚Äì I found THREE sponsors to support me! üéâ
This was an initiative I had started before Hawai‚Äôi (a bit hastily, I must say), and my club and the city of Le Havre had stepped up to give me a hand! This time, I once again used my portfolio to approach businesses. It&amp;rsquo;s quite uncomfortable and strange (for me) to do this. Sport is a passion, and I don&amp;rsquo;t do it to make money. But it&amp;rsquo;s a good way to involve local companies or simply get people involved in a sporting adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Tacher Acogex, an accounting firm, volunteered to support me in my sporting project. I can never thank Laura enough for believing in me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration, a British sports nutrition company that offered its support. Given the amount of food we ingest for triathlon training, this assistance is very welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m also fortunate to be able to rely on Culture V√©lo Le Havre to support me and ensure performance by helping me finance the acquisition of a disc wheel and the maintenance of my equipment. It&amp;rsquo;s a huge plus for my practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone for your support!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-we-are-finland&#34;&gt;Here we are Finland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But back to our story. Off we went to Finland (our two daughters, Audrey, and I), with our dear friends M√©lanie and Vincent and their two children. Well, I had to take the plane the day before because my bike had been rejected a week before due to some baggage quota issue. I&amp;rsquo;ll spare you the panic, the flight change with additional costs, and the additional expenses (train, hotel night, etc.). Even though it&amp;rsquo;s not the first time we&amp;rsquo;ve had these kinds of hiccups, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot of energy and stress. Everyone arrived safe in the end, and here we were again on the roads of Finland amid forests and lakes, after a last-minute stress because we struggled to put the bike suitcase into the car (that was tough, right Vincent?). Honestly, travelling with a bike is &amp;ldquo;a bit&amp;rdquo; of a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t give you a detailed story of our vacation, but between the lakeside house with no neighbours within earshot, grasshopper fishing, boat rides, and the bearskin on the living room wall, it was a true joy to be there. The children loved it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ironkids&#34;&gt;IRONKIDS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids also had their first race for IRONKIDS, except for Livia, who had already done her first race in Hawai‚Äôi (not a bad start for her sports career). Another moment full of emotions; P√©n√©lope, at the tender age of 1 and a half, covered the entire 300 metres in one go (she also tried to grab another child&amp;rsquo;s cookie on the side). Esteban took off so quickly he almost left us behind, and Paola gave us an epic 200-metre sprint finish. SO COOL! All of this took place in a massive athletics stadium right next to the ski jump ramps, very, very impressive.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;race-day&#34;&gt;Race day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recall the beginning of the story, we woke up late, but we still made it on time and before the bike park closed. In the end, we put unnecessary pressure on ourselves, ah ah&amp;hellip; I was surprisingly calm this morning, Audrey wasn‚Äôt, whereas usually, it&amp;rsquo;s the opposite. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s good to switch roles because pre-race stress is really not my favourite part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the race venue without any issues; I went to the bike park. Everything was okay, the bike was ready (with my magnificent disc wheel thanks to Culture V√©lo Le Havre!). I placed my bottles on it, shoes were clipped onto the pedals and secured with elastics (to be able to jump on the bike at the transition exit), and the tires were well-inflated. We just had to head to the start area about 1 km away. The pros had already started and exited the water; I would have liked to see them, but I was in the race too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short 5-minute jog, I put on the wetsuit, swim for 5 minutes (a good habit I&amp;rsquo;ve developed to avoid having burning shoulders at the start of the race, very unpleasant), even though I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of getting wet before cracking on. It&amp;rsquo;s 8:20, and my start is in 10 minutes. So, I think it would be a good idea to get there. I finish getting ready, everyone wishes me good luck, I shed a small tear (as usual), it&amp;rsquo;s so cool to have my family and friends by my side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I head to the starting area; each age group starts separately every 15 minutes, with a rolling start (meaning in groups of 7 people). Surprisingly, I&amp;rsquo;m alone even though the start is in 5 minutes. I still find it strange that no one is there 5 minutes before the start, and then I realise that I must actually be the ONLY ONE NOT YET in the starting area. A little moment of stress and a sprint later, I join the other 500 athletes in my category, who were all already ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I deserve a small (according to my wife, a big) slap on the head. I‚Äôm here taking my time without panicking and almost missing the start. It&amp;rsquo;s not like I&amp;rsquo;ve never had issues before. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m ready, I try to get as close to the front as possible but quickly get stuck, and I blame myself because I know I&amp;rsquo;ll be swimming with triathletes slower than me in the water, and that&amp;rsquo;s not good. It means I&amp;rsquo;ll spend my time zigzagging and losing time. Another mistake not to repeat. We start from a pontoon that is a metre above the water; I knew that in advance, so I practised diving to get used to it and not lose my goggles along the way. I&amp;rsquo;m calm and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s my turn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few metres to run before diving, where everyone joyfully pushes each other (we&amp;rsquo;re all still boys who like to play around in the end, ah ah ah), and I &amp;ldquo;dive.&amp;rdquo; The dive itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad (I didn&amp;rsquo;t belly flop), but the two guys next to me did a pretty rubbish jump, pushing me at the same time, so I dove quite crooked. And I lost my goggles in the process&amp;hellip; I come out with the goggles askew, luckily no one sees it, I put them back on, and I paddle my arms to find my place. Sorry to those who got bumped, it&amp;rsquo;s part of the game. I took a few hits too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swimming goes well, even though, as expected, I spend my time overtaking and zigzagging to pass people. The water is less cold than expected (18 degrees), probably because of the adrenaline running through my veins. I have to stop several times completely because large packs have formed. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit chaotic. Overall, I swam ok, and much better than in previous years, in 28&#39;55&amp;quot;. I know I could have swum faster, but I would have had to stop daydreaming at the start!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many spectators and a lively atmosphere during the transition, with all my supporters on the side! The bike park is quite large, so there is quite a bit of distance to cover to retrieve the bag, change, take my lucky bracelet (crafted by Paola üíô), grab the bike, and head out on the course. Five minutes later, I pass the mounting line and cautiously get on my bike; my hands are a bit cold, but other than that, it‚Äôs all good.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the race is rolling, like the rest, with no major difficulties except for a few climbs that don‚Äôt last more than 5-10 minutes, so it was fast riding all the way! The roads are straight and well-maintained, very enjoyable. Quite a few people were already on the bike; we (the 30-34 age group) started after many other categories. After a few kilometres, an uninvited guest (well-known in Normandy) arrived for the party. Rain. Not just raindrops. POURING RAIN. One minute later, I was soaked, and the rain didn&amp;rsquo;t stop until the end of the day. I felt like I was at the Battle of Helm&amp;rsquo;s Deep in The Lord of the Rings. You really think about strange things during a race. I also thought about my speech for the following week, as I was becoming the godfather of my friends&#39; daughter üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the pouring rain, with my arms getting increasingly numb, and being careful not to fall. Not much to say during the bike since I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see anything with the rain, except for the guys drafting unashamedly even though it&amp;rsquo;s prohibited, while the referees would pass by without saying anything. I just can‚Äôt get it. These guys are at the half IRONMAN World Championships, and they cheat (as soon as you don&amp;rsquo;t respect the rules, it&amp;rsquo;s cheating, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit disappointed in the athletes&#39; attitude, but maybe I expect too much. I would have liked the referees from the IRONMAN Austria to be there; they wouldn‚Äôt forgive anything. I remember being in a group of 7, making sure to respect the drafting distance (i.e., staying far enough from the bike in front of me to avoid being in the drafting zone and risking a 5-minute penalty), but I was the only one. The referees passed once on a motorcycle, stopped at the next roundabout, and came back putting a penalty card on everyone except me. Ah ah ah. Justice üòÇ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the hardest part is drinking because my hands are so frozen that I can‚Äôt squeeze my water bottle. And my whole nutrition is in the bottle, so not drinking is not an option! I reach the end of the course and hear the sweet sound of my wife&amp;rsquo;s megaphone, what a pleasure! I start to feel some leg pain towards the end, but nothing serious, so far, everything is going smoothly. 2 hours 15 minutes and 50 seconds to cover the 90km, averaging 39.7 km/h, I&amp;rsquo;ve never ridden so fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition zone is a huge (like really huge!) sports hall, and it takes me more than 4 minutes to transition to running. The size of the sports facilities in the city of Lahti is incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides frozen fingers, the rest of my body is fine, and I set off happily for a half marathon, determined to enjoy myself and break the curse of my heel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The running course is quite demanding, with some hills and very long climbs. Over 200m of positive elevation gain is a lot for a half marathon, especially in triathlon. So, it&amp;rsquo;s not a flat race, and there&amp;rsquo;s no hope of achieving a fantastic time. Two laps of 10.5km each, with a passage on the stadium where we had the IRONKIDS. The race alternates between sections in the woods and passes through lakeside homes; a very nice run!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first lap goes smoothly, with great sensations. I pass many people and run at over 16km/h; I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased. I remember passing the 15km sign (for the second lap) and thinking, &amp;lsquo;when you pass this on the second lap, nothing can stop you, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to fully enjoy.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run into all my supporters, who, despite the rain, are there to cheer me on.&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  

  
  
  
  
  
    
      
    
  
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-gallery6&#34; data-caption=&#34;running man&#34; href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-lahti-2023-6.jpg&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/img/ironman-lahti-2023-6.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I start the second lap, and I feel an athlete starting to catch up with me. It&amp;rsquo;s the first person who&amp;rsquo;s going to overtake me, so I tell myself it&amp;rsquo;s time to hang on and see what I have left in my legs. The person comes next to me, and I set my pace the same, which, in the end, is not much higher than mine. We didn&amp;rsquo;t look at each other, but I felt an unspoken agreement and an immediate synchronisation. Some may find it strange, but the connection was there. And the show began! We set a very good pace and start passing a ton of athletes. I felt like a steamroller, and the kilometres passed effortlessly. It was truly exciting. That&amp;rsquo;s how I met Read (Ziegler). Although our strides were very different, with his being very powerful, and mine being quite elastic (a true deer), we challenged each other on the uphills and downhills. He has an impressive physique, and I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m running next to Terminator üòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I reached the 15th kilometre, I realised that it was even easier than I thought to make the most of the present moment. Sometimes, we experience quite unique adventures; I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of Finland with my loved ones, participating in the Half IRONMAN World Championships. It&amp;rsquo;s pouring rain, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a challenging year physically and mentally, but I&amp;rsquo;ve just found an American pal to run the end of the half marathon with, and I feel great. What a thrill!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We reach the 19th kilometre, and the race is ending soon. I decide to start a conversation with Read. We&amp;rsquo;ve been running almost 10km side by side without exchanging a word, even though we started running together. He tells me it&amp;rsquo;s his first lap since he&amp;rsquo;s in the 25-29 age category, and they started after us. I tell him I‚Äôm sad it‚Äôs the end of the race, and that I would have liked to do a third lap, even though, well, even if I feel good, I‚Äôm getting tired. Finally, he tells me that he will miss me ü§ó Awesome run together. There&amp;rsquo;s 1km left, I tell Read that I&amp;rsquo;m going to let it all out to finish the race, and I wish him to have fun and enjoy the second lap, to which he replies with a very American &amp;ldquo;Yes, Sir,&amp;rdquo;, love it üòÇ. I rush past my supporters, finishing the race in a somewhat euphoric state, so relieved to finally have a good race without pain. I have a vague memory of &amp;ldquo;expressing my joy&amp;rdquo; (read shouting as hard as I can) before the finish line, completing the half marathon in 1h19&#39;12&amp;quot; and the entire race in 4h12&#39;18&amp;quot;. My best time for this distance, despite the quite challenging course and the rain worthy of a Norman autumn. Training and efforts have paid off.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  
  
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read will finish the race in 4h05&#39;42&amp;quot;, what an athlete! I&amp;rsquo;m really happy to have shared this moment with him. I‚Äôm used to running alone, so it was very cool to run with someone, especially someone as strong as him!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ended up being 47th/518 in my age group (30-34 years old) in a very strong field (less than 30 seconds for the 4 athletes in front of me), and 203rd/3935 overall (including the pros). Cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading this far; it&amp;rsquo;s so much easier to write reports about &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; races! What can I say except a huge thank you to all the people who support me in my adventures‚Äîmy wonderful daughters who endured the rain during the race, my family, friends, colleagues (current or former), my coach Romain Guillaume, my partners (Tacher Acogex, Culture V√©lo Le Havre, Precision Fuel &amp;amp; Hydration), my physio Antoine, my osteopath Pierre-Antoine, my triathlon club HAC, my beloved SRE team üíöüíô (they are direct witnesses of how hard Thursday training days can be üòÇ), my company Doctolib, and my village of Mannevillette.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again, the person who is always by my side, without whom I would be lost ü©µ (even if we almost missed the race because of the alarm!). I often say it, but beyond the race and training, it&amp;rsquo;s a whole organisation and logistics to think about to make everything work, to get to the race, and, above all, not jeopardise our relationship. Audrey and I really are a team, and most of the actions we put in place come from her. She&amp;rsquo;s the brains of the group, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest üòÇ I&amp;rsquo;m the legs, and I execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, life is like elevators; there are ups and downs. When there are downs, you have to grit your teeth and double your efforts while waiting to climb back up. When there are ups like today, you have to enjoy the moment to the fullest before the next down üòÇ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;T1:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bike:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 bottles (1L each) with 60g of PF&amp;amp;H mix (60g of carbs/1000mg of sodium)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H caffeine gel 30g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Run:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 PF&amp;amp;H gel 90g&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that gives around 109,7g carbs, 731mg of sodium and 605mL of water per hour for this race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to go, I&amp;rsquo;ll let you enjoy the view we had from our house in Finland:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where shall I start? ü§î 19th of July 2020, I finished my registration for  IRONMAN Finland in August 2021, with in mind the goal of being much stronger than before, and also to finally finish a full IRONMAN. The one I did in Nice in 2019 was shortened due to the heat wave. I also had a secret goal of qualifying for the IRONMAN world championship in Hawa√Ø, for which I had to be in the top 3 of my age group (30-34 years old). This was a bold goal, as I ranked 27th at Nice, a long  away from the podium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn‚Äôt come up with this objective randomly. I knew I had a chance given what I thought I should be able to do with a decent training plan, and the statistics I analysed for other athletes who qualified the previous years. So  I thought, why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it turned out‚Ä¶ It was a success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cut a long story short, we ARE going to Hawai√Ø! I managed to finish second in my age group and 13th overall, way beyond my expectations. I had five sub goals when I arrived at the race:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To swim less than an hour on the 3.8km (~2.3 miles) swim - I failed ‚ùå&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To cycle less than 5 hours on the 180km (~111 miles) bike race - Also failedl ‚ùå&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To run less than 3 hours  during the marathon (26 miles) - Failed again‚ùå&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To qualify for Hawai√Ø - I succeeded ‚úÖ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To do an awesome race and be proud of myself - I succeeded ‚úÖ&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two out of five, not that good, the two most important ones are successes though. I almost managed to nail the other three too, so quite awesome overall! Here are some details about the race:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finish time&lt;/strong&gt; 9h16‚Äô21‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd in my age group (30-34 years old)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;9th man overall&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;13th overall (yeah the pro females are faster than me, they are SO impressive!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swim 3.8km&lt;/strong&gt; - 1h02‚Äô02‚Äù
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1‚Äô38‚Äù/100m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;34 strokes/min on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;47th overall (not so good)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition T1&lt;/strong&gt; - 2‚Äô54‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bike 180km 1200m D+&lt;/strong&gt; - 5h04‚Äô10‚Äù
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;35.51 km/h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200 Watts on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;211 Watts normalized power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;220 TSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;59th overall (this is bad‚Ä¶)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition T2&lt;/strong&gt; - 2‚Äô14‚Äù&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run 42km 400m D+&lt;/strong&gt; - 3h05‚Äô04‚Äù
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4‚Äô24‚Äù/km&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;309 Watts on average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;159 RSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3rd overall (this is good!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still some work to do to improve swimming and biking, running is good enough. Let‚Äôs see what happened during the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;training-plan-and-going-to-finland&#34;&gt;Training plan and going to Finland&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was in fact the most crucial part to perform correctly during the IRONMAN. One year of training and planning, trying to validate steps and improvements, all of this during several lockdowns. I definitely wanted to reach the next level on the bike and the swim, as I was pretty fed up of being largely beaten by other athletes. I knew my running was enough though, but it wouldn‚Äôt be enough to be on the podium!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my swim time during IRONMAN Nice was 1h01‚Äô, going for a sub 1 hour was in my reach. But, that assumption was in an ideal world without the Covid pandemic, that led to shutting down the swimming pools in October&amp;hellip;. I didn‚Äôt even have the time to re-start swimming seriously. However, I was super determined to do a good preparation, and even more determined to make it to the starting line with no regret and no excuse. It‚Äôd be too easy to say ‚ÄúI could have done better without the Covid‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I went to my parents to pick up an inflatable swimming pool, just deep enough to swim statically in it, and I set it up in my garden. It was just a matter of time before I had fixed a rope on the pole outside the swimming pool, tied that rope to an old inner tube (to get some sort of elasticity), then tied that tube to a belt around my waist, and here I was swimming ! It‚Äôs boring, it feels different , but at least I could train. With my wetsuit on obviously. I still wonder what my neighbors thought when passing by next to the house üòÖ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick reminder on Norman weather in autumn and winter, it‚Äôs not that warm. The water in the pool slowly cooled down from 13 degrees to less than 5 starting in December. It was ok when it was around 10 to 13, but I had to put on gloves, neoprene socks, and an additional neoprene hooded vest when the water was between 5 and 10. And I swam for 15 to 20 minutes before I thought I would freeze to death! It was almost impossible to swim more than 15 minutes below 5 degrees. I don‚Äôt have enough fat on my belly üòÅ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your body loses its heat really rapidly when you are in cold water, and once it starts cooling down, all your blood goes to your vital organs, so no blood in your hands, feet, etc. Then it starts to really hurt. I am not usually the soft kind, I can handle pain, but it was really very painful. The worst being when you finally take a shower and the blood goes back to your hands. I am not ashamed to say that I actually screamed a couple times because of the pain üòÖ such a pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But reap what you sow, so I would go back three times a week, not knowing if my swimming  would improve, but at least I wouldn‚Äôt get worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many months after, the swimming pools eventually opened again, it took a couple months to go back to my previous level. Since I was determined to have the best chance of succeeding, I thought it would be interesting to swim in open water too, as the swim race would be in a lake. But we don‚Äôt have lakes in Normandy, we have the sea, but it‚Äôs definitely not the same. So‚Ä¶ I had a look on Google Maps, spotted two big ponds (around 200 meters long) next to the Ch√¢teau du Bec (a big medieval castle you can rent for weddings), and called the owner. I explained my plan to her and everything. She  was really enthusiastic and told me to come and give it a go! Here I was, once or twice a week, walking down the castle enclosure with my wetsuit in my backpack to go for a swim in the lake. An amazing  experience, I could get used to swimming with the wetsuit, swim in a straight line, not freak out when a fish came next to me or when I touched a stick floating in the water üòÖ What a blast for a medieval fan like me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the bike, I had already made some improvements since the half IRONMAN world championships in Nice in 2019. The idea was to keep improving and also work a lot on the aero position, as I now have a real triathlon bike. Maintaining a good position is a real challenge when you have to keep it for several hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from a couple of outside rides, I stayed indoors on the trainer, i.e. in my garage in front of a screen. Some workouts would be super intense but would last an hour, some would be easy but really long (4 to 5 hours). I spent quite a lot of Saturday mornings watching films, listening to some podcasts or music, reading books, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main advantage of the trainer is that your legs always have to push the pedals, so there‚Äôs no coasting during a workout (brief periods where you don‚Äôt pedal at all). That makes the workout much more time effective. Plus you don‚Äôt have to worry about  the weather or the cars on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I went up to around 15 hours of training per week, which is quite a lot when you also want to spend  time with your family and go to work! There‚Äôs always a moral contract your family and you have to agree on, otherwise you‚Äôre going to have some issues. All my workouts were in the calendar, including the time at which I would do them and how long they would last. I would share my feelings about my training, and make the necessary adjustments if needed, because life is not straightforward ! I also didn‚Äôt want triathlon to interfere with my life too much. My daughter doesn&amp;rsquo;t care about my training, she won‚Äôt ask if I‚Äôm tired, she just wants me to play and run after her üòÅ that‚Äôs what it really takes to be an ironman !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here we are arriving in Finland, fully vaccinated, fully prepared for the race. Audrey and Livia are with me, we get to the house in the evening on Tuesday, the race is on Saturday. The wooden house is right next to a big lake in the middle of the forest, we definitely are in Finland! Three days to go to the athlete registration, do a quick bike ride on the roads we are going to race on, swim in the lake, check the legs can still run fast and drop the transition bags and the bike on Friday. We also made the most of that time to have some rest, it‚Äôs been a while since our last holiday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could feel the stress mounting as the race day got closer. One evening, Audrey gave me a big envelope in which I discovered a TON of letters, drawings, cards, and cheerful messages from my family and friends. My sisters even made a special song just for me ! I will come back to it later on but I was really (REALLY) touched by all that love and I must say I cried a lot üòÜ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Race day, finally, legs are burning from excitement, stomach filled up with breakfast. Audrey didn‚Äôt sleep well, but funnily enough I did üòÜ Our daughter woke up on her own 15 minutes before departure, she‚Äôs a perfect little girly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We jump in the car and go to the transition zone only five minutes away for home, super easy logistics for this IRONMAN! Last bike check up, I put all my drinks and food in the bags and on the bike, last mental visualisation of the transition to perform, and we walk to the start line. Weather is amazing, a clear blue sky with 17 degrees, it‚Äôs going to be a fine day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just enough time to warm up a bit, put my wetsuit on, and give a last kiss to my daughter and wife. So much effort and training to be here, so many people behind me to support me, it‚Äôs finally happening. I turn to Audrey and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to cry so hard if don‚Äôt focus‚Äù üòÜ (I‚Äôm still trying to focus when writing the report!). I went to the starting line, started doing fist bumps to cheer on other athletes, this is going to be so awesome! In position, 3, 2, 1‚Ä¶ BIP! All out now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;swim&#34;&gt;Swim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped in the lake (turns out I just walked in the water when I had a look at Audrey&amp;rsquo;s video üòÇ, not so epic) and started swimming. Water was perfect (20 degrees), compared to the swimming pool in the garden in December, it‚Äôs heaven. It almost has a sweet taste, so much better than sea water. I scream in the water to let out some emotion, I am so happy to be racing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can seem a bit weird, but we are so filled up with adrenaline, hormones, and emotions that it has to come out one way or another. My arms felt good. Now I just had to wait for 3.8 km‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs quite a long way when you swim, and since you can‚Äôt hear anything (your head is mostly below the surface), nor can you see (or really quickly when you take a breath), it tends to be a bit boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still made the most of it though, the lake and the landscape was beautiful, the sun was just above the treetops, I had almost no one around me so it was easy to relax and swim like during training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the water in 1h02‚Äô, that‚Äôs 2 minutes behind schedule but I felt really fresh, as if I hadn‚Äôt swum at all, which is good because there was still 8 to 9 hours of race ahead. I ran to my bike, put on my helmet, bib, and socks and rushed through the exit, less than 3 minutes, very good. My bike shoes were already clipped on the pedals to save some time, I just had to slip my feet in and start pushing the pedals for the next 180 km!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bike&#34;&gt;Bike&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riding your bike is fun, you can go fast, you see a lot of different landscapes, but most of the time it ends  with a sore bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick ride on the same road a couple days before, I was pretty confident I could ride the 180 km in less than 5h. It was not a technical road, it was long straight lines between the trees. So much different than in Nice where you had to really concentrate! It was never flat though. No big climbs or descents, but the real challenge was to handle the always changing road where you could hardly maintain a regular pace for more than a few minutes. On top of the undulating road, the trees and the lakes next to the road would create strange air masses, making it hard to understand why you would suddenly ride at 30 km/h in a descent and speed up to 45km/h in the next climb with a strong headwind. That was quite disturbing, so I focused on my wattage to stay in the power zones I knew I could hold for four or five hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was split into two 85 km loops, and connected to a 5 km (3.1 mile) segment towards the bike park. The weather was really nice, it was warm and sunny, and despite the strong wind on some portions, I enjoyed riding my bike! But even though I had made some significant improvements on the bike, I was still unable to compete properly with the other guys, which was a bit frustrating‚Ä¶ But that was not enough to disturb me or make me diverge from my plan. An IRONMAN is first a race against yourself, trying to overdo it or following someone you don‚Äôt know nearly always ends up in failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So stick to the plan, and trust yourself. Speaking of plans, I also strictly followed my nutrition and hydration plans, with custom date bars and honey gels. When we think about sport, we most of the time think about the workouts. When it comes to endurance sports, and especially long races like an IRONMAN, nutrition and hydration are key! You simply cannot hold your pace for multiple hours without fuelling your body, that‚Äôs humanly impossible. And the more quality food you ingest, the better. You are not going to put standard gas in a race car right? Same goes for your body. It‚Äôs also better to eat the same things you are used to eating during training, because your gut becomes highly efficient to digest that food, the easier the better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fine bike leg in the end, no mechanical issues, no sliding, nothing but strong riding through the middle Finland landscapes. It rained heavily  for the last 20 minutes, the weather started to deteriorate unfortunately‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I eventually reached the bike park after 5h04‚Äô, a bit behind schedule again, but I had to hold back during the last 40 km as my left thigh started cramping during climbs. And boy you are going to need that leg on the 42 km run race! The only thing I had in mind was to show the other athletes that even though they beat me on the bike, I would crush them on the run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;run&#34;&gt;Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I jumped off my bike and ran to my rack position, I emptied my shoes carefully, in which I put my nutrition for the run, that‚Äôs a pro tip to avoid forgetting something üòÅ I then rushed through the bike park and started leaping like a stag. My legs felt a bit achy but that was the normal state after 5 hours of bike, I knew that wouldn‚Äôt prevent me from running fast. First kilometer done in 4‚Äô06‚Äù (almost 15 km/h), it didn‚Äôt feel like I was running, it felt so easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to do a sub 3h marathon, so that meant staying at a 4‚Äô16‚Äù/km pace or lower. The course was quite technical, a lot of little climbs and descents on gravel roads or trails, not that easy! Maintaining a steady pace was again not possible, and there were almost zero entirely flat sections. But nevermind, legs are good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four 10km loops for this course. One of the good things about being at the front of the race is that you‚Äôre on your own on the first laps, so you have all the supporters on the side of the road just for you! Especially the two best supporters of the world, my wife and daughter üòÅ Even when they were out of sight, I could hear Audrey‚Äôs megaphone. I would then run proudly past them, waving and smiling at them. Hard not to cry and keep your composure to be honest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not the kind of athlete who remains concentrated and focused on the road in front of him, I like to enjoy the encouragement and thank the volunteers (even if it‚Äôs just a smile when you are gasping for air). It gives so much energy to share this moment, and not to mention that smiling makes the effort easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 25 km, pace was still steady and I had already overtaken most of those who had beaten me on the bike. I told you the race was not finished! Third lap ongoing, there were a lot of people on the course now as they had finished the bike leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One month before the race, I told Audrey that I was a bit afraid of the marathon, not about finishing it but rather being able to maintain the pace I had in mind. I feared I didn‚Äôt run enough kilometers. I would do 40 to 50 km per week, which is not a lot when considering a marathon training plan, but I thought that focusing on bike and swimming would be more beneficial. Well, it turned out I was right, the last 10 km were really tough! After 30 km, I could feel my thighs had become as hard as rocks, and they felt really achy. I didn‚Äôt feel like I didn‚Äôt have energy, just that my muscles were burnt. On top of that, it started raining, like heavy rain, we were all soaked to the bone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then used one of the things for which I made a lot of improvements lately. It took me 30 years to realise how powerful emotions are, how to listen, understand and make the most of them. I would describe myself as cold blooded, that‚Äôs not the case anymore. During such a long race, you experience pain, suffering, motivation, despair, determination, euphoria and so many more emotions. What you do with them can totally change your race. I can‚Äôt remember how many times I finished some workouts in tears, because the intensity was so high and it would take all I had to go through the pain. But using emotions helps you go way further than what you think, where physical pain is no longer a limitation. It‚Äôs disturbing, you feel ridiculous for crying on your bike, but it feels so good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I used it all, all the emotions, the support from the people on the race, the shot of love and adrenaline each time I passed by my little family. The pace had slowed down a bit, my body was hurting and begging to stop, but I hanged on and thought about all my family and friends who were following the race on the IRONMAN tracker! There‚Äôs no way I will stop. 35, 36, 37, less and less kilometers to go, 38, 39, 40, last aid station, 41‚Ä¶ one kilometer, just one to enjoy the present, the race that went almost according to plan, the feeling you gave it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn‚Äôt see the finish line yet but I was already crying. I sprinted through the last climb, I saw Audrey on the side next to the red carpet. My body was moving on its own, I barely remember these moments, I can only remember when I crossed the finish line, jumping and screaming my happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Audrey after the finish line, took my daughter in my arms, I was exhausted but so happy. One of the athletes who arrived just before me was in the same emotional state, he was French and we would later realise that on top of being a super nice guy, we were going to share the two first places on the podium, amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the pace slowing down at the end, I did the 3rd time on the run with 3h05‚Äô, I said that was my specialty üòÇ Time to rest now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three days have passed since the race, the soreness is gone but I‚Äôm still a bit euphoric. I am really proud and pleased about my performance, and even more about my qualification to Hawai√Ø for the IRONMAN world championships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot end this report without saying thank you a million times to all the people who were with me (even remotely) during that journey, my family and friends. All I can say is I love you, I am deeply happy to have such wonderful people in my life. I said it a lot of times to Audrey, it felt weird and I was embarrassed to receive so many messages just for me. I‚Äôll say it again, I was really (really really) touched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also like to thank my running club LHSA, my local town Mannevillette and my employer Doctolib for supporting me in my adventures, and it‚Äôs not over yet! Thank you so much Nathalie for letting me swim in the Ch√¢teau du Bec lake, it&amp;rsquo;s been awesome! hank you again and again to Rosalie from LibreForme8, my nutrition angel üòä&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you in Hawai√Ø, aloha!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week after the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.olivier-gerbron.fr/en/accomplishments/ventouxman-2020/&#34;&gt;Ventouxman&lt;/a&gt;, here I am again for another race for the Deauville Triathlon on Sunday the 27th of September. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been long enough to recover from the previous race, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t miss an opportunity to race in 2020 as so many races were cancelled. That one was originally scheduled in June (and postponed in September), and I chose to do the Olympic distance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1500m Swim&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;40km Bike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10km Run&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On arr√™te tout de suite avec les &amp;ldquo;ah mais c&amp;rsquo;est facile pour toi c&amp;rsquo;est super court comme format&amp;rdquo; üòë. Une fois pour toutes, ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas une question de distance mais d&amp;rsquo;intensit√©. L&amp;rsquo;intensit√© de l&amp;rsquo;effort diminue avec l&amp;rsquo;allongement de la distance ü§ì, donc plus c&amp;rsquo;est court plus l&amp;rsquo;effort est violent, donc c&amp;rsquo;est loin d&amp;rsquo;√™tre plus facile. Faites le test, courez tranquillement pendant 40 min et courez √† fond pendant 10 min, on verra lequel est le plus cool üòõ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bref, vu les conditions du week-end dernier j&amp;rsquo;esp√©rais un peu de soleil, mais la Normandie n&amp;rsquo;√©tait pas de cet avis. Du vent avec de bonnes rafales toute la semaine, un bonheur. Le samedi avait lieu d&amp;rsquo;autres formats de course √† Deauville (une distance d√©couverte et une distance L), et l&amp;rsquo;organisation a d√ª annuler la natation vu la hauteur des vagues dans la mer. On croise les doigts (ü§û) quand m√™me mais le beau temps n&amp;rsquo;est pas annonc√© pour le dimanche, on verra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ce qui devait arriver arriva, arriv√© sur place le dimanche, du vent et un peu de pluie, avec une mer toujours aussi houleuse, la natation est donc remplac√©e par de la course √† pied (comme pour les autres √©preuves), c&amp;rsquo;est donc le duathlon de Deauville finalement. Ce sera 3km de course √† pied √† la place de la nage.
Ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas aujourd&amp;rsquo;hui que j&amp;rsquo;essaierai ma nouvelle combinaison (je d√©sesp√®re). Je me r√©jouis quand m√™me, la course aura lieu, j&amp;rsquo;ai un car entier de supporters ü•∞, je vais enfin faire une course avec Benjamin (depuis le temps), j&amp;rsquo;ai re√ßu mon nouveau v√©lo la veille (m√™me si je sais pertinemment que ce n&amp;rsquo;est pas une bonne id√©e de l&amp;rsquo;utiliser si t√¥t, mais au moins je le sais üòÖ), et il fera moins froid que sur le Ventouxman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D√©p√¥t des affaires dans le parc √† v√©lo (j&amp;rsquo;ai bien mon porte dossard? Oui üòÖ), il y a beaucoup de sables et de petites dunes qui se sont form√©es √† cause du vent, √ßa va faire mal aux jambes pendant les transitions, et √ßa met surtout des grains de sables dans la transmission du v√©lo (et √ßa c&amp;rsquo;est mal, surtout sur un v√©lo tout neuf üò≠). Le v√©lo de Benjamin est √† quelques m√®tres du mien, et on rigole en disant qu&amp;rsquo;on va pouvoir mettre nos blagues en oeuvre. Le premier arriv√© dans le parc √† v√©lo pour la transition pourra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enlever la selle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Couper les lacets des chaussures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voler une des chaussures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;D√©gonfler les pneus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cacher une barre √©nerg√©tique dans une chaussure (ah non d√©j√† fait)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On s&amp;rsquo;amuse comme on peut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direction le d√©part sur la plage, avec les 500 premiers m√®tres de la course √† pied dans le sable, g√©nial! Je commence √† m&amp;rsquo;√©chauffer s√©rieusement, le d√©but de course va √™tre assez rapide et je pr√©vois de faire les 3km en 3&#39;30&amp;quot;/km (environ 17km/h), pour ne pas laisser trop d&amp;rsquo;√©nergie avec le passage dans le sable et pour ne pas √™tre trop fatigu√© sur le dernier 10km. L&amp;rsquo;organisation annonce l&amp;rsquo;ouverture des sas de d√©part pour dans quelques minutes, j&amp;rsquo;ai encore le temps.
Les concurrents sont cens√©s se placer dans les sas correspondant √† leur niveau, afin que chacun y trouve son compte, mais on sait comment √ßa se passe üòÖ.
Environ 15 secondes plus tard les sas sont ouverts (on a pas la m√™me notion de &amp;ldquo;quelques minutes&amp;rdquo;), je me retrouve donc en pleins milieu de la foule, et je dois donc demander aux gens de se pousser pour pouvoir √™tre dans les premi√®res lignes. Parce que oui au bout d&amp;rsquo;un moment quand on s&amp;rsquo;entra√Æne on sait qu&amp;rsquo;on va avoir plus de monde derri√®re soit que devant, sans pr√©tention bien √©videment, et si on veut &amp;ldquo;faire sa course&amp;rdquo; et ne pas √™tre g√™n√© par les moins rapides, il faut se mettre devant.
Sauf que le sas est petit et qu&amp;rsquo;il y a beaucoup de monde, je me retrouve avec une bonne centaine de personnes devant moi, et je n&amp;rsquo;ose pas leur demander pour passer devant üòì
Il faudra vraiment que je me fasse violence pour les prochaines courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le d√©part est donn√© (enfin pour ceux qui sont sur la premi√®re ligne üòì), 6 athl√®tes partent toutes les 6 secondes. C&amp;rsquo;est&amp;hellip; long. Quelques minutes plus tard je pars enfin. Le sable n&amp;rsquo;est pas trop mou donc on peut tout de m√™me courir assez vite mais je reste prudent. Je double les gens que je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas os√© doubler dans le sas, et on arrive sur le bord de plage, on peut enfin relancer. Il y a beaucoup de gens devant et je passe donc mon temps √† slalomer pour doubler. Premi√®re partie finie en 12&#39;57&amp;quot; √† 3&#39;36&amp;quot;/km de moyenne, un peu moins rapide que pr√©vu mais le sable ralentit beaucoup, et au moins je n&amp;rsquo;ai vraiment pas eu l&amp;rsquo;impression de forcer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;rsquo;attrape mon v√©lo et mon casque et m&amp;rsquo;extrais tant bien que mal des dunes pour rejoindre la sortie du parc √† v√©lo, je saute sur ma selle et en avant! Le parcours v√©lo est assez technique avec de grosses bosses, pas un trac√© que j&amp;rsquo;affectionne mais on fera de son mieux! J&amp;rsquo;avais pr√©vu de faire environ 290 Watts de moyenne sur cette partie, puisque je savais que je pouvais tenir sur environ 1h et faire une bonne course apr√®s (cf la &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.ironmanvirtualclub.com/en/challenges/details/20-06-ironmanvr10championshipseries&#34;&gt;course virtuelle IRONMAN&lt;/a&gt; en Juin dernier).
Premi√®re difficult√© apr√®s 2km, la c√¥te de Saint Laurent avec 1km √† 15% (le col du ventoux c&amp;rsquo;est facile √† c√¥t√©), je garde les yeux sur mon capteur de puissance, 400 Watts&amp;hellip; tout va bien üòÖ Certains cyclistes me d√©passent, je me dis qu&amp;rsquo;ils sont soit vraiment bons grimpeurs, soit qu&amp;rsquo;ils font une erreur. Ambiance de folie pendant la mont√©e, on se croirait au tour de France!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je relance apr√®s la c√¥te et reprends ceux qui m&amp;rsquo;ont doubl√© (et qui ont apparemment du mal √† reprendre leur souffle ah ah ah üòÅ), parcours vallonn√© comme pr√©vu et peu de portions plates pour se mettre correctement dans la position a√©ro (c&amp;rsquo;est √† dire les bras sur les prolongateurs), mais je suis quand m√™me super content d&amp;rsquo;√™tre sur mon nouveau v√©lo et dans une course!! Un des b√©n√©voles m&amp;rsquo;indique je suis 50√®me, c&amp;rsquo;est bien j&amp;rsquo;ai d√©pass√© du monde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apr√®s 10km, j&amp;rsquo;ai des sensations bizarres dans les bras en position a√©ro, et je d√©couvre en me relevant que les prolongateurs se sont desserr√©s, c&amp;rsquo;est chaud. Le gars du magasin de v√©lo m&amp;rsquo;avait dit que ce serait normal que les serrages bougent un peu au d√©but avec du mat√©riel tout en carbone.
J&amp;rsquo;avais bien fait les r√©glages avant la course mais avec les dos d&amp;rsquo;√¢ne et les trous dans la route c&amp;rsquo;√©tait pr√©visible. Je me dis que √ßa va le faire, puis au bout d&amp;rsquo;un kilom√®tre je me dis que non, je vais finir par terre. Je m&amp;rsquo;arr√™te donc sur le c√¥t√©, sors mon petit kit de r√©paration et resserre tout proprement.
Je me dis que j&amp;rsquo;aimerai bien qu&amp;rsquo;il ne m&amp;rsquo;arrive aucune aventure pendant un triathlon, au moins UNE fois dans ma vie. Mais √ßa ferait des rapports de course moins sympa.
Je repars avec plus de 2 min de perdue, je red√©passe les gens que je venais de d√©passer, et essaie de faire ma course correctement. Apr√®s 30km un des b√©n√©voles me dit que je suis 30√®me, c&amp;rsquo;est cool! La route est assez mouill√©e et il y a pas mal de feuilles par terre, il faut donc rester vigilant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le reste du v√©lo s&amp;rsquo;est fait sans encombre, m√™me si j&amp;rsquo;ai eu du mal √† garder une allure stable. Les quelques bosses font vraiment mal aux jambes et j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression que √ßa va impacter la course derri√®re, donc je reste sur la r√©serve. Bonne fin de parcours o√π nous √©tions 5 coureurs avec √† peu pr√®s le m√™me niveau en v√©lo, c&amp;rsquo;√©tait cool! Derni√®re descente √† plus de 80km/h üò® et on arrive de nouveau sur la plage de Deauville.
Je mange ma derni√®re barre √©nerg√©tique √† la datte (qui sera dans mon ventre et pas dans ma chaussure), elles sont vraiment tr√®s bonnes (et je les fais moi m√™me, donc c&amp;rsquo;est encore meilleur). Beaucoup plus de supporters ici, j&amp;rsquo;entends ma m√®re me crier &amp;ldquo;Come on, that&amp;rsquo;s my boy!&amp;rdquo; ü•∞ü•∞ et on remet un coup dans les p√©dales pour aller encore plus vite, parce qu&amp;rsquo;on est fier!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;rsquo;aper√ßois l&amp;rsquo;entr√©e du parc √† v√©lo, je retire mes chaussures √† l&amp;rsquo;avance, et je saute pied nus sur le sol en passant la ligne d&amp;rsquo;entr√©e du parc, 10/10 en style. Je rejoins mon emplacement en me disant que le parc est quasiment vide, c&amp;rsquo;est bon signe pour le classement. Je finis le v√©lo √† 250 Watts de moyenne, donc loin des 290 Watts pr√©vus, il faudra que je m&amp;rsquo;entraine plus sur des parcours de ce type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je d√©boule sur la course √† pied avec en t√™te une esp√©rance de chrono de 35&#39; sur les 10km, les jambes vont tr√®s bien mais il y a beaucoup de vent et des passages dans le sable, √ßa va √™tre dur de tenir la cadence. Je pars en 3&#39;40&amp;quot;/km (16,5km/h) et je commence √† rattraper le peu de concurrents d√©j√† sur la course √† pied.
Je passe devant mes supporters üòç (encore plus motiv√©s que moi!), √ßa fait chaud au coeur! Premi√®re boucle de 5km (sur deux) pass√©e en 18&#39;30&amp;quot;, l&amp;rsquo;allure est bonne malgr√© le vent. Deuxi√®me passage devant les supporters (encore plus bruyants qu&amp;rsquo;au premier tour üòÇ), je rejoins un autre participant qui court √† la m√™me vitesse, et je d√©cide d&amp;rsquo;acc√©l√©rer sur le dernier kilom√®tre, j&amp;rsquo;ai d√©cid√©ment un peu trop g√©r√© la course üòê.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Je termine la course √† la 14√®me place sur 1023, bon r√©sultat malgr√© les erreurs que j&amp;rsquo;ai faites (mais qui font partie de la course), je sais maintenant que si je veux arriver pr√®s du podium, il faut prendre ses responsabilit√©s. Bonne course dans l&amp;rsquo;ensemble, ce format n&amp;rsquo;est pas trop fatigant pour le corps donc ce sera un exercice √† reproduire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une fois encore merci √† mes incroyables supporters que sont ma famille, √ßa semble √©vident mais les encouragements sont tellement puissants dans une course. Merci √† mon entreprise Karhoo et mon club de course √† pied le LHSA pour leur support, et toujours Rosalie de &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libreforme8.com/&#34;&gt;Libreforme8&lt;/a&gt;, qui m&amp;rsquo;a donn√© l&amp;rsquo;id√©e de ces supers barres √©nerg√©tiques √† la datte (entre autres!). Chapeau √† Benjamin et √† ses soeurs pour leur performance, ce fut un plaisir de faire cette course avec vous!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il est temps de se reposer maintenant, 2021 va √™tre charg√©e!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une ann√©e est pass√©e depuis mon dernier triathlon √† Nice (pour les championnats du monde Ironman 70.3 √† Nice), parce que occup√©s
√† √™tre parents et qu&amp;rsquo;un virus a annul√© toutes les courses. Un petit championnat tout de m√™me avec les courses virtuelles Ironman
organis√©es en juin, mais tr√®s diff√©rent d&amp;rsquo;une &amp;ldquo;vraie&amp;rdquo; course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bref me voici engag√© dans la course du Ventouxman avec l&amp;rsquo;un de mes amis Matthieu, avec au programme:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 km de natation dans le lac de Lapalud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90 km de v√©lo, avec l&amp;rsquo;ascension du Mont Ventoux (donc un total de 2300m D+, c&amp;rsquo;est&amp;hellip; beaucoup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;20 km de course √† pied en for√™t, avec 400m D+ et des passages assez techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avec un an de triathlon en plus dans les jambes, j&amp;rsquo;ai h√¢te de voir les progr√®s que j&amp;rsquo;ai pu faire sur le v√©lo, m√™me si l&amp;rsquo;entra√Ænement
fut loin d&amp;rsquo;√™tre optimal. L&amp;rsquo;objectif √©tait surtout de voir o√π en √©tait la machine et de prendre le d√©part avec l&amp;rsquo;un de mes meilleurs amis (Matthieu), √ßa rajoute du plaisir et des souvenirs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriv√©s sur place la veille, le protocole anti Covid rend le d√©p√¥t des v√©los plus rapide, au moins √ßa de gagn√© en √©nergie perdue √† attendre.
Mon emplacement v√©lo est juste √† la sortie de la natation, juste √† c√¥t√© des v√©los des pros üòÅ, bon point quand on sort de l&amp;rsquo;eau un peu √©tourdi! Derni√®re √©tape, d√©p√¥t du sac pour la course √† pied, et pendant la conversation, Matthieu me parle du porte dossard, et l√†&amp;hellip; je m&amp;rsquo;exclame &amp;ldquo;J&amp;rsquo;ai oubli√© mon porte dossard √† la maison le ***&amp;rdquo;.
Matthieu rigole avant de se rendre compte qu&amp;rsquo;il l&amp;rsquo;a lui aussi oubli√© ah ah ah&amp;hellip; les deux gars super contents de faire la course ensemble et qui ne font pas bien leur sac.
D&amp;rsquo;habitude je suis un vrai militaire sur la discipline et la logistique d&amp;rsquo;avant course, √ßa m&amp;rsquo;apprendra √† me rel√¢cher.
Sauf qu&amp;rsquo;il nous en faut absolument un, on se rend dans les stands de la course, aucun porte dossard, on se dit donc qu&amp;rsquo;on va aller au D√©cathlon le plus proche.
Il est pas loin c&amp;rsquo;est cool, je dis en rigolant √† Matthieu &amp;ldquo;Ce serait dr√¥le qu&amp;rsquo;il y en ait plus qu&amp;rsquo;un&amp;rdquo; ah ah ah. Ah ah ah&amp;hellip; üòÖ parfois c&amp;rsquo;est bien de se taire.
Je propose √† Matthieu de se battre (en toute amiti√©) pour savoir qui aurait le porte dossard, mais il refuse en rigolant (parce qu&amp;rsquo;il sait tr√®s bien qu&amp;rsquo;il va perdre).
On demande au vendeur s&amp;rsquo;ils n&amp;rsquo;en ont pas en stock, la r√©ponse est non forc√©ment.
Direction le D√©cathlon √† 20min de route, o√π on trouve enfin un autre porte dossard,sauv√©s!
Que de stress et d&amp;rsquo;√©nergie perdue&amp;hellip; On rejoint la maison pour se d√©tendre et pr√©parer les affaires pour le lendemain, avec nos compagnes respectives et baby ü•∞&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D√©part de la course √† 7h40, donc lev√©s √† 5h45, ce sera Pauline qui nous d√©posera sur le lieu du d√©part pour laisser baby dormir.
Deux oeufs, ol√©agineux et un caf√©, petit d√©jeuner typique d&amp;rsquo;avant course, et on prend la voiture.
On se raconte qu&amp;rsquo;on a tous entendu l&amp;rsquo;orage pendant la nuit, il reste quelques grondements dans le lointain, mais la m√©t√©o annonce juste un peu de pluie, pas tr√®s grave.
Je pr√©f√®re cette temp√©rature que la canicule que l&amp;rsquo;on avait eu sur l&amp;rsquo;Ironman de Nice en 2019. Arriv√©e au parc √† v√©lo, on regonfle les pneus, on pr√©pare les affaires.
Je rejoins Matthieu √† son v√©lo et commence √† mettre ma nouvelle combinaison de natation (que je vais ENFIN pouvoir utiliser dans une course).
Et en m√™me temps commence une douce pluie, qui se transforme quelques secondes plus tard en averse, oblig√©s de s&amp;rsquo;abriter sous les arbres! Les √©clairs z√®brent de plus en plus le ciel, et on compte les secondes entre la lumi√®re et le son pour constater que l&amp;rsquo;orage se rapproche de nous, pas bon.
L&amp;rsquo;heure du d√©part approche mais l&amp;rsquo;organisation temporise, en nous pr√©venant que l&amp;rsquo;orage devrait nous contourner. Vingt minutes plus tard l&amp;rsquo;organisation nous annonce qu&amp;rsquo;ils vont √™tre oblig√©s d&amp;rsquo;annuler la natation, l&amp;rsquo;orage ne se calme pas (la pluie non plus) et nager dans ces conditions est trop dangereux.
Normal, mais extr√™mement d√©cevant! Le d√©part sera donc √† 8h15, avec seulement du v√©lo et de la course √† pied. Le probl√®me est que nous avons tous d√©j√† donn√©s nos affaires d&amp;rsquo;apr√®s course, nous sommes donc pour la plupart sous la pluie avec nos affaires de course d√©j√† tremp√©es, et que l&amp;rsquo;on refroidit assez vite.
Quelques minutes plus tard, nouvelle annonce, les conditions au sommet du Mont Ventoux sont tr√®s dangereuses, orage, pluie torrentielle, vent √† 100km/h et du brouillard, autant dire bien trop p√©rilleux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La d√©cision est act√©e de r√©duire le v√©lo √† 75km et d&amp;rsquo;emprunter la mont√©e par Maleuc√®ne, et donc de ne pas monter jusqu&amp;rsquo;en haut du Ventoux, dommage. La pluie se calme (mais il pleut toujours), et le d√©part commence finalement √† 8h30. De nombreux participants pr√©f√®rent abandonner avant le d√©part, il faut vraiment se faire violence pour oublier le froid actuel et les conditions de course qui nous attendent.
Je grelotte de froid en m&amp;rsquo;approchant de la ligne de d√©part, je n&amp;rsquo;ai que ma trifonction (tr√®s fine) et mes manchons que j&amp;rsquo;avais pr√©vu au cas o√π. Deuxi√®me erreur de logistique, il faut tout pr√©voir pour une course en montage. Je passe devant Matthieu (les d√©part sont donn√©s par ordre de dossard croissant), et enfin les premiers coups de p√©dale, il est temps de se rechauffer un peu!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J&amp;rsquo;ai depuis peu un capteur de puissance sur mon v√©lo, qui me permet de tr√®s bien g√©rer mon allure. Pour les geeks des chiffres, j&amp;rsquo;avais pr√©vu (avec l&amp;rsquo;aide du site &lt;a href=&#34;https://bestbikesplit.com&#34;&gt;bestbikesplit&lt;/a&gt;) de partir sur une moyenne de 250 Watts, que je savais pouvoir tenir plus de 3h et pouvoir faire une bonne course √† pied derri√®re. Il fallait donc rester √† 220 Watts sur les 50 premiers kilom√®tres puis monter √† 280 Watts sur la mont√©e du col. Je me cale donc √† cette allure, bien pos√© sur mes prolongateurs. Les jambes ont bien progress√©! Je roule entre 37 et 40 km/h sans difficult√©, et je double beaucoup de monde. Les choses ont chang√© depuis Nice, je suis vraiment content! On encha√Æne les routes assez plates, le d√©but du parcours est vraiment roulant. J&amp;rsquo;arrive √† rester calme bien que les jambes bouillonnent d&amp;rsquo;√©nergie. La pluie a un tout petit peu cess√©e, enfin. Premi√®re difficult√© apr√®s 50km √ßa grimpe fort, je m&amp;rsquo;ajuste √† 280-290 Watts et je me dis que √ßa passe facile. La pluie reprend de plus belle, encore plus fort qu&amp;rsquo;au d√©part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premi√®re (et derni√®re parce qu&amp;rsquo;il n&amp;rsquo;y a que de la mont√©e) descente un peu technique, passage que j&amp;rsquo;affectionne particuli√®rement. Sauf que c&amp;rsquo;est impossible d&amp;rsquo;aller vite, l&amp;rsquo;eau tombe tellement fort qu&amp;rsquo;il y a un torrent sur la route, je me prends beaucoup d&amp;rsquo;eau dans les yeux avec la pluie qui tombe et l&amp;rsquo;eau qui remonte des pneus, mes yeux sont r√©duits √† deux petites fentes, et la visibilit√© est vraiment r√©duite. Pour courronner le tout, mes jantes en carbone (qui n&amp;rsquo;offrent d√©j√† pas un super freinage) donnent l&amp;rsquo;impression de freiner dans le vide, je suis oblig√© d&amp;rsquo;anticiper plus de 100m √† l&amp;rsquo;avance pour √©viter de me retrouver dans le d√©cors. Pas grave, c&amp;rsquo;est le jeu!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On attaque enfin le plat principal, la mont√©e par Malauc√®ne. J&amp;rsquo;ai choisi de ne pas regarder mon compteur de kilom√®tre pour rester concentr√© sur les watts, je n&amp;rsquo;ai donc aucune id√©e d&amp;rsquo;o√π est l&amp;rsquo;arriv√©e, mais √ßa m&amp;rsquo;aide √† rester dans le pr√©sent. On grimpe, on grimpe, la pluie n&amp;rsquo;arr√™te toujours pas de tomber, √ßa ressemble plus √† du kayak que du v√©lo. Je suis plut√¥t bien, les jambes sont ok, j&amp;rsquo;ai chaud et je me nourris r√©guli√®rement. Sauf que quand on grimpe, la temp√©rature descend, et on grimpe&amp;hellip; doucement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vers la moiti√© de la mont√©e, je me rends compte que mes doigts sont plus proches du bleu que du blanc, et j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression d&amp;rsquo;avoir les bras et les pieds engourdis.
Pas vraiment une impression puisque 10min plus tard je me dis que je commence vraiment √† avoir froid, alors que je monte toujours √† 290 Watts (environ 90% de ma FTP, donc grosse intensit√©). Je vois le camion de la croix rouge passer, je pense que certains font de l&amp;rsquo;hypothermie. Quelques kilom√®tres plus haut, mon souffle fait de la vapeur d&amp;rsquo;eau avec le froid et la pluie, et je n&amp;rsquo;ai vraiment plus aucune sensation dans les pieds et les mains.
J&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression d&amp;rsquo;√™tre en Normandie en plein hiver! La course se corse un peu, mais je vois une borne sur le c√¥t√© indiquant la fin de la mont√©e dans 5km, ouf!
Quelques coups de p√©dales plus tard je vois l&amp;rsquo;entr√©e du parc de transition, et je suis oblig√© de m&amp;rsquo;arr√™ter avant la ligne pour d√©chausser, impossible de desserer mes chaussures avec les doigts gel√©s.
Je cours tant bien que mal jusqu&amp;rsquo;√† mon emplacement, je tremble de froid et j&amp;rsquo;ai du mal √† calmer ma respiration. C&amp;rsquo;est la premi√®re fois de ma vie que j&amp;rsquo;ai aussi froid (et pour ceux qui me connaissent j&amp;rsquo;ai globalement toujours chaud). Je change de chaussures avec quelques cris de douleurs, et je m&amp;rsquo;√©lance pour la course √† pied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les 20km ont √©t√© r√©duits √† 15km, donc seulement 3 tours de 5km. Premi√®re exp√©rience de course √† pied avec les pieds et les jambes gel√©es, franchement √† √©viter üòÖ j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression d&amp;rsquo;√™tre Forest Gump avec ses armatures m√©talliques lorsqu&amp;rsquo;il √©tait petit. Mon souffle est toujours saccad√©, je tremble pendant que je cours et mes jambes sont tellement froides qu&amp;rsquo;elles se contractent erratiquement, et surtout douloureusement.
Je suis oblig√© de faire des tous petits pas pour √©viter les crampes et les douleurs. Bonne nouvelle par contre, le parcours est vraiment tr√®s cool, et le peu de coureurs m&amp;rsquo;indiquent que je dois √™tre assez bien plac√©! 5km plus tard la chaleur revient enfin, et je peux enfin reprendre une vraie foul√©e. Je redouble les participants qui m&amp;rsquo;avaient doubl√©s pendant mon tour de (r√©)chauffe, je vais pas me laisser abattre!
Passage du premier tour sous les encouragements d&amp;rsquo;Audrey, Pauline et baby, √ßa ravigote! Deuxi√®me tour avec de biens meilleurs sensations, et surtout une sensation √©trange dans la chaussure gauche, parce que j&amp;rsquo;ai l&amp;rsquo;impression qu&amp;rsquo;elle est pleine de terre (logique puisque l&amp;rsquo;on court dans la boue). Puis je r√©fl√©chis et me souviens que pour pr√©parer les transitions, je mets dans mes chaussures ce dont j&amp;rsquo;aurai besoin pour √©viter de fouiller dans le sac. Je compte les barres √©nerg√©tiques que j&amp;rsquo;ai dans ma poche dorsale (dattes et noix de cajou ü§§, une, deux&amp;hellip; O√π est la troisi√®me? Voil√† voil√†, c&amp;rsquo;est donc de la datte que je sens entre mes doigts de pied, et que je vois ressortir par les mailles de la chaussure, classe. Une bonne histoire √† raconter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Troisi√®me et dernier tour, je d√©roule et je me sens bien, un quatri√®me tour ne m&amp;rsquo;aurait pas d√©rang√©, m√™me dans ses conditions. Je suis quand m√™me content d&amp;rsquo;en terminer, le froid m&amp;rsquo;a vraiment fait mal.
Je passe la ligne en 4h19 et finis en 49√®me position. Nous √©tions 850 inscrits, seulement 530 ont termin√© (entre les non partants et les abandons, c&amp;rsquo;est l&amp;rsquo;h√©catombe).
Le niveau devant √©tait vraiment √©lev√©, j&amp;rsquo;aurai peut √™tre gagn√© quelques places sans le froid, mais je pense que je suis √† ma place. J&amp;rsquo;attends l&amp;rsquo;arriv√©e de Matthieu, qui a l&amp;rsquo;air vraiment serein, il a vraiment progress√© aussi, c&amp;rsquo;est top!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Une super exp√©rience malgr√© les conditions dantesques, mon seul regret est de ne pas avoir pu profiter du paysage, parce qu&amp;rsquo;on ne voyait absolument rien.
Apparement je n&amp;rsquo;ai pas √©t√© le seul √† avoir quelques m√©saventures, puisque Matthieu a crev√©. Apr√®s 5km de course üòÜ Il faudra revenir! Place √† la r√©cup et √† la prochaine course le week-end prochain (avec un PORTE DOSSARD!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enorme merci √† nos supportrices (üòçüòç), √† mon entreprise Karhoo pour son support, √† mon club de course √† pied le LHSA, et toujours Rosalie de &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.libreforme8.com/&#34;&gt;Libreforme8&lt;/a&gt;, pour ses conseils si efficace pour ma nutrition et mon hydratation. Et surtout merci √† Matthieu d&amp;rsquo;avoir fait cette course avec moi, un super moment de partage.&lt;/p&gt;
